dnl
dnl Finds the compiler and linker flags for linking with the Berkeley DB
dnl library.  Provides the --with-bdb, --with-bdb-lib, and --with-bdb-include
dnl configure options to specify non-standard paths to the Berkeley DB
dnl library.
dnl
dnl Provides the macro INN_LIB_BDB and sets the substitution variables
dnl BDB_CPPFLAGS, BDB_LDFLAGS, and BDB_LIBS.  Also provides INN_LIB_BDB_SWITCH
dnl to set CPPFLAGS, LDFLAGS, and LIBS to include the Berkeley DB library,
dnl saving the current values first, and INN_LIB_BDB_RESTORE to restore those
dnl settings to before the last INN_LIB_BDB_SWITCH.  Defines HAVE_BDB and sets
dnl inn_use_BDB to true if the library is found.
dnl
dnl Provides the INN_LIB_BDB_OPTIONAL macro, which should be used if Berkeley
dnl DB support is optional.  This macro will still always set the substitution
dnl variables, but they'll be empty unless --with-bdb is given.  Defines
dnl HAVE_BDB and sets inn_use_BDB to true if the Berkeley DB library is found.
dnl
dnl This file also provides INN_LIB_BDB_NDBM, which checks whether the
dnl Berkeley DB library has ndbm support.  It then defines HAVE_BDB_NDBM and
dnl sets inn_cv_lib_bdb_ndbm to yes if ndbm compatibility layer for Berkely DB
dnl is available.  Either INN_LIB_BDB or INN_LIB_BDB_OPTIONAL must be called
dnl before calling this macro.
dnl
dnl Depends on the lib-helper.m4 framework.
