dnl INN defaults to a umask of 002 for historical reasons, but offers an
dnl option to change them.  It also has some programs that are occasionally
dnl installed with special permissions in some situations but not in others
dnl (and not by default).

dnl Let the user specify a new umask and also set the directory and file
dnl permissions at the same time.  Also let the user request inews or rnews
dnl be installed with special permissions.
