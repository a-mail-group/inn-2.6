	* Update to latest upstream config.guess, config.sub and libtool
	  versions

	* Bump revision number for next release and copyright year

	* Allow again the use of UTF-8 in header fields
	  
	  Regression since INN 2.6.1. Posts with internationalized header
	  fields (UTF-8) are now accepted again.

	* Update libtool from upstream 2.4.6-6 Debian version

	* Update to latest upstream config.guess and config.sub files

	* Update to latest pgpverify 1.30
	  
	  The previous INN release was done before the official release of
	  pgpverify 1.30; that's why a few comments differed.

	* Bump version information for our libraries released with INN
	  2.6.3
	  
	  A few interfaces have changed in libinn (fqdn function, and new
	  innconf parameter).

	* nnrpd: improve logging of failed connections
	  
	  Properly logs the hostname of clients whose connection failed
	  owing to an issue during the negotiation of a TLS session or high
	  load average. Nothing was previously logged.
	  
	  Thanks to Paolo Amoroso for the bug report.

	* Fix a const discarding when assigning a variable
	  
	  Python 3.7 changed the return value of PyUnicode_AsUTF8 from char
	  to const char.

	* Update to latest C TAP Harness upstream version

2018-12-02  iulius

	* Update comments of TLS implementation (it is not v1 only)

	* Take into account return values of chdir and system commands

	* Update to latest rra-c-util upstream version, improving Perl and
	  Python support at configure time

	* Update to latest rra-c-util upstream version
	  
	  The Autoconf m4 macros now check that the library's key header
	  can be found as well as the library. It removes the need of
	  several checks added in configure.ac to achieve that.
	  
	  Also fix INN_LIB_KRB5_OPTIONAL probing in the
	  --enable-reduced-depends case when linking with libkrb5 is not
	  possible but libcom_err is present. The probes for com_err were
	  previously not skipped, resulting in a non-empty KRB5_LIBS
	  containing only -lcom_err, which incorrectly caused the macro to
	  indicate that Kerberos libraries were present.

	* Take into account new GCC 7.0 and 8.0 warnings
	  
	  Merge commits 10193 and 10291 from CURRENT.

	* Rewrite GetFQDN and rename to inn_getfqdn
	  
	  Use getaddrinfo with AI_CANONNAME instead of the tedious code to
	  find an FQDN in gethostbyname results. Return a newly-allocated
	  string instead of using a static buffer, since this function
	  isn't performance-critical, avoiding buffer management
	  complexity. Adjust call sites to do proper memory allocation
	  handling of the return value.
	  
	  Remove some old disabled code to try to force canonicalization by
	  adding a period to the end of the DNS query.
	  
	  Patch from Russ Allbery (backported from CURRENT).

	* Mention in POD documentation that TLS 1.3 no longer allows
	  TLS-level compression

	* inn.conf: Add new tlsciphers13 parameter to fine-tune TLS 1.3
	  cipher suites
	  
	  A separate cipher suite configuration parameter is needed for TLS
	  1.3 as TLS 1.3 cipher suites are not compatible with TLS 1.2, and
	  vice-versa.
	  
	  The tlsciphers13 parameter is based on the already existing
	  tlsciphers parameter for TLS 1.2 and below.

	* Fix the use of elliptic curve selection
	  
	  OpenSSL 1.1.0 removed the SSL_CTX_set_ecdh_auto function
	  introduced with OpenSSL 1.0.2. This removal caused INN to always
	  enforce NIST P-256 instead of using the most secure curve (which
	  OpenSSL 1.1.0 does by default). Now fixed.

	* Enable Perl and Python when testing snapshots

2018-05-21  iulius

	* Update to latest C TAP Harness and rra-c-util upstream versions

	* Add trailing comment in CHECK and TAKETHIS responses
	  
	  Responses to CHECK and TAKETHIS commands did not mention the
	  reason of a reject (notably from Python or Perl filter hook, but
	  also directly from innd main checks). This is now fixed.
	  
	  closes #148

	* Various number of typo fixes
	  
	  Thanks to Christoph Biedl for the bug report.

	* Add support for embedded Python 3 interpreter to use with innd
	  and nnrpd filter hooks
	  
	  * Update configure script to find Python 3 interpreter and
	  correctly set linker flags for embedding it. Python 3.3.0 or
	  later in the 3.x series is now supported.
	  
	  * Drop support for Python 2.2.0; now, Python 2.3.0 or later in
	  the 2.x series is required because configure looks for a shared
	  Python library, installed in the main library location in Python
	  2.3.0 and later.
	  
	  * Add m4 macros to check for minimal Python version and module
	  presence at configure time.
	  
	  * Notable changes for Python 3 are: - string literals are now
	  considered as Unicode data whereas they were mere bytes in Python
	  2. Consequently, encoding now really matters for strings, and
	  UTF-8 is required in return values of Python filter hooks. (Note
	  that compliance with NNTP would also want strings to be encoded
	  in UTF-8.) Care should be given to use the right str or bytes
	  objects in Python 3.
	  
	  - buffer objects no longer exist: they have been replaced with
	  memoryview objects. Consequently, code to deal with them slighty
	  changed.
	  
	  - integers no longer exist in the C API: they have been replaced
	  with long integers (Py_ssize_t).
	  
	  - embedded Python initialization is now done differently (with a
	  PyMODINIT_FUNC function). Try to homogeneize initialization with
	  Python 2.x.
	  
	  * Improve error/notice logs.
	  
	  * Update and improve both documentation and samples accordingly.
	  
	  * Remove unused PYpathkey char * variable.
	  
	  * A few typo fixes.

	* Fix prototypes in clientlib man page

	* Typo fixes
