##  This file is meant to be the central Makefile that configure works with
##  and that all other Makefiles include.  No Makefile other than this one
##  should have to be a configure substitution target.
##
##  For installation paths, see the bottom of this file.

##  This version information is used to generate include/inn/version.h and is
##  used by INN for banner and local version identification.  The version
##  identification string will be "$VERSION ($VERSION_EXTRA)", with the
##  parentheses omitted if $VERSION_EXTRA is empty (as it is for major
##  releases).	If you make extensive local modifications to INN, you can
##  put your own version information in $VERSION_EXTRA.  If it's set to
##  "prerelease", the build time will be automatically included.
##      If you modify these two strings, you must encode them in UTF-8
##      (using only US-ASCII characters is consequently also fine) and
##      keep their length reasonable; otherwise, your news server will not
##      be complying with the NNTP protocol.

##  Basic compiler settings.  COPT is the variable to override on the make
##  command line to change the optimization or add warning flags (such as
##  -Wall).  LFS_* is for large file support.  All of INN is built with the
##  large file support flags if provided.

##  Warnings to use with gcc.  Default to including all of the generally
##  useful warnings unless there's something that makes them unsuitable.  In
##  particular, the following warnings are *not* included:
##
##    -ansi                 Requires messing with feature test macros.
##    -pedantic             Too much noise from embedded Perl.
##    -Wdouble-promotion    Too much noise from using printf with floats.
##    -Wswitch-default      Quite annoying to enforce it.
##    -Wstrict-overflow=2   Gives false positives.
##    -Wtraditional         We assume ANSI C, so these aren't interesting.
##    -Wtraditional-conversion
##                          Warns about problems when upgrading from K&R to
##                          ANSI C, so these aren't interesting.
##    -Wundef               We need portability code.
##    -Wshadow              Names like log or index are too convenient.
##    -Wunsafe-loop-optimizations
##                          Too much noise.
##    -Wcast-qual           Used for a while, but some casts are unavoidable.
##    -Wconversion          Too much unsigned to signed noise.
##    -Waggregate-return    Syntax allowed in C.
##    -Wmissing-noreturn    Not necessary (unless for optimization).
##    -Wpacked              Used by INN.
##    -Wpadded              Used by INN.
##    -Wredundant-decls     Too much noise from system headers.
##    -Wlong-long           Too much noise from system headers.
##    -Woverlength-strings  Useless noise.
##    -Wunused-function     Noise from embedded Perl (at least with Perl 5.20).
##
##  Some may be worth looking at again once a released version of gcc doesn't
##  warn on system headers.  The warnings below are in the same order as
##  they're listed in the gcc manual.
##
##  Last checked against gcc 6.3.0 (2017-11-04).
##  Add -g because when building with warnings, one generally also wants the
##  debugging information, and add -O3 because gcc won't find some warnings
##  without optimization turned on.  Add -DDEBUG=1 so that we'll also
##  compile all debugging code and check it as well.
##  It would be worthwhile trying to enforce the following checks:
##  -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 enables warn_unused_result attribute markings
##  on glibc functions on Linux, as well as more object size checking,
##  which catches a few more issues.
##  -Wformat=2, -Wswitch-enum, -Wfloat-equal, -Wlogical-op,
##  "-Wconversion -Wno-sign-conversion",
##  -Wunreachable-code, -Wstack-protector, -Wdeclaration-after-statement

##  Installation commands.  These commands are used by the installation
##  rules of each separate subdirectory.  The naming scheme is as follows:
##  the first two characters are CP (indicating a plain copy) or LI
##  (indicating an installation that goes through libtool).  After an
##  underscore is a one-character indicator of the file type (R for a
##  regular file, X for an executable, S for a setuid root executable, L for
##  a shared library) and then PUB for a world-readable/world-executable
##  file or PRI for a group-readable/ group-executable file (only the news
##  group).
##
##  Man pages should not be backed up with an .OLD extension since it causes
##  man to complain about bogus filenames in MANPATH.  Shared libraries
##  should not be backed up with an .OLD extension since ldconfig will
##  select the .OLD version in preference to the regular version.  We use
##  shared library versioning to allow recovery from make update for shared
##  libraries.
##
##  inews and rnews have their own special installation rules, as do database
##  files like active and newsgroups that should have the same permissions as
##  article files.
