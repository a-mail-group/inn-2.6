**
**  Replacement for a missing ftello.
**
**  ftello is a version of ftell that returns an off_t instead of a long.
**  For large file support (and because it's a more logical interface), INN
**  uses ftello unconditionally; if ftello isn't provided by a platform but
**  fpos_t is compatible with off_t (as in BSDI), define it in terms of
**  fgetpos.  Otherwise, just call ftell (which won't work for files over
**  2GB).
