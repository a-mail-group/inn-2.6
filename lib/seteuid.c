 * Replacement for a missing seteuid.
 *
 * Some systems don't have seteuid but do have setreuid.  setreuid with -1
 * given for the real UID is equivalent to seteuid on systems with POSIX saved
 * UIDs.  On systems without POSIX saved UIDs, we'd lose our ability to regain
 * privileges if we just set the effective UID, so instead fake a saved UID by
 * setting the real UID to the current effective UID, using the real UID as
 * the saved UID.
 *
 * Note that swapping UIDs doesn't work on AIX, but AIX has saved UIDs.  Note
 * also that systems without setreuid lose, and that we assume that any system
 * with seteuid has saved UIDs.
