**
**  Replacement for a missing pwrite.
**
**  Written by Russ Allbery <eagle@eyrie.org>
**  This work is hereby placed in the public domain by its author.
**
**  Provides the same functionality as the standard library routine pwrite
**  for those platforms that don't have it.  Note that pwrite requires that
**  the file pointer not move and without the library function, we can't
**  copy that behavior; instead, we approximate it by moving the file
**  pointer and then moving it back.  This may break threaded programs.
