##
##  Run indent on source files with INN options.
##
##  This is a simple wrapper around GNU indent to call it with all of the
##  options suitable for INN's coding style and typedefs.  These options
##  are also documented in HACKING.  Assumes indent is on the user's path.
##
##  The order of options matches the order in which they're described in
##  the GNU indent info manual.  In order, each line sets options for:
##  blank lines, comments, statements, declarations, indentation, breaking
##  long lines, and typedefs used by INN.
##
##  Note that the resulting output should not be used without manual review,
##  nor should this script be run automatically.  indent still has a few
##  bugs, tends to mangle case statements written compactly, and varies from
##  the prevailing INN style in a few ways that can't be changed.
