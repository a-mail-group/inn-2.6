**
**  Data structures for the tradindexed overview method.
**
**  This header defines the data structures used by the tradindexed overview
**  method.  Currently, these data structures are read and written directly to
**  disk (and the disk files are therefore endian-dependent and possibly
**  architecture-dependent due to structure padding).  This will eventually be
**  fixed.
**
**  The structure of a tradindexed overview spool is as follows:  At the root
**  of the spool is a group.index file composed of a struct group_header
**  followed by some number of struct group_entry's, one for each group plus
**  possibly some number of free entries linked to a free list that's headed
**  in the struct index_header.  Each entry corresponds to a particular
**  newsgroup carried by the server and stores the high and low article
**  numbers for that group, its status flag, and the base of the index file
**  for each group.
**
**  The storage of the group.index file implements a hash table with chaining;
**  in other words, there is a table indexed by hash value stored in the
**  header that points to the starts of the chains, new entries are appended
**  to the end of the file and added to the hash table, and if they collide
**  with an existing entry are instead linked to the appropriate hash chain.
**
**  The overview information for each group is stored in a pair of files named
**  <group>.IDX and <group>.DAT.  These files are found in a subdirectory
**  formed by taking the first letter of component of the newsgroup name as
**  a directory name; in other words, news.announce.newgroups overview data is
**  stored in <pathoverview>/n/a/n/news.announce.newgroups.{IDX,DAT}.  The
**  .DAT file contains the individual overview entries, one per line, stored
**  in wire format (in other words, suitable for dumping directly across the
**  network to a client in response to an OVER command).  The overview data
**  stored in that file may be out of order.
**
**  The .IDX file consists of a series of struct index_entry's, one for each
**  overview entry stored in the .DAT file.  Each index entry stores the
**  offset of the data for one article in the .DAT file and its length, along
**  with some additional metainformation about the article used to drive
**  article expiration.  The .IDX file is addressed like an array; the first
**  entry corresponds to the article with the number stored in the base field
**  of the group_entry for that newsgroup in the group.index file and each
**  entry stores the data for the next consecutive article.  Index entries may
**  be tagged as deleted if that article has been deleted or expired.

   Groups are matched based on the MD5 hash of their name.  This may prove
   inadequate in the future.  Ideally, INN really needs to assign unique
   numbers to each group, which could then be used here as well as in
   tradspool rather than having to do hacks like using a hash of the group
   name or constructing one's own number to name mapping like tradspool does.
   Unfortunately, this ideally requires a non-backward-compatible change to
   the active file format.

   Several of these elements aren't used.  This structure, like the others,
   cannot be changed until the whole format of the group.index file is changed
