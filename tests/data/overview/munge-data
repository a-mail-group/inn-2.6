##  Munge .overview data into something suitable for test data.
##
##  This script isn't used regularly and is here only for the use of INN
##  developers and other people needing to generate more overview test data.
##  It expects overview data but possibly with extra fields at the end, snips
##  off To: data (to avoid putting people's e-mail addresses into INN test
##  data), and if Newsgroups: data is present, rewrites the Xref header to use
##  it instead of keeping the Xref data (this is so that I can use .overview
##  files from Gnus as test data).  It generates overview data but with the
##  newsgroup name and a colon prepended to the article number so that it can
##  be split apart into overview data for multiple groups.
##
##  Please don't include overview information for people's articles into INN's
##  test suite without their permission.
