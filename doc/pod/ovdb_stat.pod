are displayed.

and counting them.  This can be a lengthy operation on groups with lots
of articles.

=item B<-i>

Internal data regarding the given newsgroups are displayed.

=item B<-r> I<artnumrange>

Overview records are retrieved.  The I<artnumrange> parameter may be
a single article number, or a range of articles in the format C<low-high>.

=head1 WARNINGS

B<ovdb_stat> may be safely killed with the INT, TERM, or HUP signals.
It catches those signals and exits cleanly.
Do not kill B<ovdb_stat> with other signals, unless absolutely necessary,
because it may leave stale locks in the database environment.
