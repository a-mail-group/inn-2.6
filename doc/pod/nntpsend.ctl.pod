=head1 NAME

nntpsend.ctl - List of sites to feed via nntpsend

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The file I<pathetc>/nntpsend.ctl specifies the default list of sites
to be fed by B<nntpsend>.  Comments begin with a number sign (C<#>) and
continue through the end of the line.  Blank lines and comments are ignored.
All other lines should consist of four fields separated by a colon.

The first field is the name of the site as specified in the F<newsfeeds>
file.

The second field should be the hostname or IP address of the remote site.

The third field, if non-empty, specifies the default head truncation size
of the batch file.  If this field is empty, no truncation is performed.
This field may be of the form C<< I<maxsize>-I<truncsize> >>, in which
case it is passed to B<shrinkfile> as C<< -m I<maxsize> -s I<truncsize>
>>; otherwise it is of the form C<< I<truncsize> >>, in which case it is
passed as C<< -s I<truncsize> >>.

The fourth field specifies some default flags passed to B<innxmit>.  Note
that the flag B<-a> is always given to B<innxmit> and need not appear here.
If no B<-t> flag is given in this field or on the B<nntpsend> command line,
C<-t 180> will be given to B<innxmit>.

See nntpsend(8) for an example of F<nntpsend.ctl> config file.
