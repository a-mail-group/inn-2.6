=head1 NAME

radius - nnrpd RADIUS password authenticator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<radius> [B<-h>] [B<-f> I<config>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<radius> is an B<nnrpd> authenticator, accepting a username and
password from B<nnrpd> (given to B<nnrpd> by a reader connection) and
attempting to authenticate that username and password against a RADIUS
server.  See readers.conf(5) for more information on how to configure
an B<nnrpd> authenticator.  It is useful for a site that already does
user authentication via RADIUS and wants to authenticate news reading
connections as well.

By default, B<radius> reads I<pathetc>/inn-radius.conf for configuration
information, but a different configuration file can be specified with
B<-f>.  See inn-radius.conf(5) for a description of the configuration
file.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-f> I<config>

Read I<config> instead of I<pathetc>/inn-radius.conf for configuration
information.

=item B<-h>

Print out a usage message and exit.

=head1 EXAMPLE

The following readers.conf(5) fragment tells B<nnrpd> to authenticate
all connections using this authenticator:

    auth radius {
        auth: radius
        default: <FAIL>
        default-domain: example.com
    }

C<@example.com> will be appended to the user-supplied identity, and
if RADIUS authentication fails, the user will be assigned an identity
of C<E<lt>FAILE<gt>@example.com>.

=head1 BUGS

It has been reported that this authenticator doesn't work with Ascend
RADIUS servers, but does work with Cistron RADIUS servers.  It's also
believed to work with Livingston's RADIUS server.  Contributions to make
it work better with different types of RADIUS servers would be gratefully
accepted.

This code has not been audited against the RADIUS protocol and may not
implement it correctly.

=head1 HISTORY

The RADIUS authenticator was originally written by Aidan Cully.  This
documentation was written by Russ Allbery <eagle@eyrie.org>.
