=head1 NAME

cnfsstat - Show usage of CNFS buffers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<cnfsstat> [B<-ahpPsv>] [B<-c> I<class>] [B<-i> I<seconds>]
[B<-l> [I<seconds>]] [B<-m> I<buffer>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<cnfsstat> reads I<pathetc>/cycbuff.conf and I<pathetc>/storage.conf
to determine which CNFS buffers are available.  It then reads the specified
cyclic buffers and shows their usage status.  B<cnfsstat> can be invoked from
B<rc.news> if I<docnfsstat> is set to true in F<inn.conf>, and the result is
written to syslog(3).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-a>

Besides its usual output, B<cnfsstat> prints the age of the oldest article
in the cycbuff.  You may also want to use the B<-v> flag to see extended
consistency checks.

=item B<-c> I<class>

Only information for the specified class is printed.

=item B<-h>

Print usage information and exit.

=item B<-i> I<seconds>

With this option, B<cnfsstat> has an initial sleep of I<seconds>
seconds at startup.  This is useful when B<cnfsstat> is started at
the same time as INN, so that it can wait a little before beginning
performing its checks.

=item B<-l> [I<seconds>]

With this option, B<cnfsstat> prints a status snapshot every I<seconds>
seconds, and only exits if an error occurs.  When unspecified, the
default interval is C<600> seconds.

At each iteration, B<cnfsstat> checks whether the F<cycbuff.conf> and
F<storage.conf> files have been modified, and loads the new configuration
if needed.

=item B<-m> I<buffer>

Print information about the specified buffer in a format suitable for MRTG.

=item B<-p>

Print an MRTG config file.

=item B<-P>

Write PID into I<pathrun>/cnfsstat.pid.

=item B<-s>

Write output to syslog(3) instead of standard output.

=item B<-v>

Write additional information, especially about consistency checks for article
storage and the F<history> file.
