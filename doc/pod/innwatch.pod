=head1 NAME

innwatch - Monitor the state of INN and the system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<innwatch> [B<-f> I<ctlfile>] [B<-i> I<seconds>] [B<-l> I<logfile>]
[B<-t> I<seconds>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<innwatch> is normally started by B<rc.news>.  Every
I<innwatchsleeptime> seconds, as set in F<inn.conf>, it examines the load
average, and the number of free blocks and inodes on the spool partition,
as described by its control file, F<innwatch.ctl> in I<pathetc>.

If the load gets too high, or the disk gets too full, it throttles
the server.  When the condition restores, it unblocks the server.
In addition, on each pass through the loop, it will check the logfile
I<pathlog>/news.crit to see if it has been modified, and send mail to
the news administrator if so.

Upon receipt of an interrupt signal (SIGINT), B<innwatch> will report
its status in the file F<innwatch.status> in I<pathrun>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-f> I<file>

Specify the control file to use, other than the default of
F<innwatch.ctl> in I<pathetc>.

=item B<-i> I<seconds>

With this option, B<innwatch> has an initial sleep of I<seconds>
seconds at startup.  This is useful when B<innwatch> is started at
the same time as INN, so that it can wait a little before beginning
performing its checks.

=item B<-l> I<logfile>

Specify a log file to watch, other than the default of F<news.crit>.

=item B<-t> I<seconds>

Specify the period in seconds between checks, to override the value
set in F<inn.conf>.
