=head1 NAME

expirerm - Remove articles that have been expired

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<expirerm> I<file>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<expirerm> is a script that removes a list of files.  The specified
I<file> lists the files to be removed.  It is usually created by
B<expire -z>.  This file is sorted, and then fed into a pipeline
responsible for doing the removal, normally B<fastrm>.  (You may want
to edit B<expirerm> to change the flags passed to B<fastrm>.)

If there seemed to be a problem removing the files, then a mail is
sent to the news administrator.  If there were no problems, then
I<file> is renamed to I<pathlog>/expire.list where it is kept
(for safety) until the next time expiration is done.
