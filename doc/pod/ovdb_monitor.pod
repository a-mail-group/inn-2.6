=head1 NAME

ovdb_monitor - Database maintenance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use B<ovdb_init> to start B<ovdb_monitor>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When started (normally by B<ovdb_init> that is invoked by B<rc.news>),
B<ovdb_monitor> forks three processes that perform routine database
maintenance tasks.  These are transaction checkpointing, deadlock
detection, and transaction log removal.

The process ID of the parent is written to F<ovdb_monitor.pid> in the
I<pathrun> directory.  This PID is used by other INN commands to verify
that B<ovdb_monitor> is running.

To shut down B<ovdb_monitor>, send a TERM signal to the process ID
in F<ovdb_monitor.pid>.  The parent process will shut down the three
children and wait for their exit before exiting itself.  Note that when
running the C<rc.news stop> command to stop the news system, B<rc.news>
automatically takes care of stopping B<ovdb_monitor>.
