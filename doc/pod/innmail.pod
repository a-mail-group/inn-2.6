=head1 NAME

innmail - Simple mail-sending program

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<innmail> [B<-h>] [B<-s> I<subject>] I<address> [I<address> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<innmail> is a Perl script intended to provide the non-interactive
mail-sending functionality of mail(1) while avoiding nasty security
problems.  It takes the body of a mail message on standard input and sends
it to the specified addresses by invoking the value of I<mta> in
F<inn.conf>.

At least one address (formatted for the MTA specified in F<inn.conf>, if it
matters) is required.  B<innmail> will sanitize the addresses so that they
contain only alphanumerics and the symbols C<@>, C<.>, C<->, C<+>, C<_>,
and C<%>.

B<innmail> was written to be suitable for the I<mailcmd> setting in
F<inn.conf>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-h>

Gives usage information.

=item B<-s> I<subject>

Sets the Subject: header of the message.  A warning is issued if this
option is omitted.

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

This sends a one-line message to the local user C<joe>:

    echo "A one-line message." | innmail -s "Simple message" joe

B<innmail> by default is used by INN for sending nightly reports and
control message reports.

=head1 BUGS

B<innmail> fails on addresses that begin with C<->, although one might
hope that the news server will not need to contact any such addresses.

There are many "correct" addresses that will be silently modified by the
sanitization process.  A news administrator should be careful to use
particularly sane addresses if they may be passed to B<innmail>.

=head1 HISTORY

B<innmail> was written by James Brister <brister@vix.com> for
