=head1 Changes in 2.6.3

=over 2

=item *

Fixed the selection of the elliptic curve to use with S<OpenSSL 1.1.0>
or later; NIST P-256 was enforced instead of using the most secure curve.

=item *

A new F<inn.conf> parameter has been added to fine-tune the cipher suites
to use with S<TLS 1.3>:  the I<tlsciphers13> now permits configuring
them.  A separate cipher suite configuration parameter is needed for
S<TLS 1.3> because S<TLS 1.3> cipher suites are not compatible with
S<TLS 1.2>, and vice-versa.  In order to avoid issues where legacy
S<TLS 1.2> cipher suite configuration configured in the I<tlsciphers>
parameter would inadvertently disable all S<TLS 1.3> cipher suites,
the F<inn.conf> configuration has been separated out.

=item *

Fixed a regression since S<INN 2.6.1> that prevented articles with
internationalized header fields (that is to say encoded in UTF-8)
from being posted.

=item *

Support for S<Python 3> has been added to INN.  Embedded Python filtering
and authentication hooks for B<innd> and B<nnrpd> can now use S<version
3.3.0> or later of the Python interpreter.  In the 2.x series, S<version
2.3.0> or later is still supported.

When configuring INN with the B<--with-python> flag, the C<PYTHON>
environment variable, when set, is used to select the interpreter
to embed.  Otherwise, it is searched in standard paths.

In case you change the Python interpreter to embed, make sure that
the Python scripts you use are written in the expected syntax for that
version of the Python interpreter.  Notably, buffer objects have been
replaced with memoryview objects in S<Python 3>, and UTF-8 encoding
now really matters for string literals (S<Python 3> uses bytes and
Unicode objects).

INN documentation and samples of Python hooks have been updated to
provide more examples.

=item *

When a Python or Perl filter hook rejects an article, B<innd> now mentions
the reason in response to CHECK and TAKETHIS commands.  Previously,
the reason was given only for the IHAVE command.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now properly logs the hostname of clients whose connection
failed owing to an issue during the negotiation of a TLS session or
high load average.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.6.2

=over 2

=item *

A new I<syntaxchecks> parameter has been added in F<inn.conf>.
It permits controlling the level of checks performed by B<innd> and
B<nnrpd>.  Up to now, only one check can be enabled/disabled:  when
I<laxmid> is mentioned in the values of this new parameter, INN accepts
Message-IDs that contain C<..> in the left part, as well as Message-IDs
with two C<@> (such Message-IDs would otherwise be considered as
syntactically invalid).  See the inn.conf(5) man page for more details.

The check is disabled by default (I<no-laxmid>), which corresponds to
the legacy behaviour of S<INN 2.6.1> and earlier.

=item *

Use of the B<ovdb_server> helper server is now the default when
using the ovdb overview method, that is to say the default value
for the I<readserver> parameter in F<ovdb.conf> is now set to true.
It improves stability and avoids deadlocks, timing issues and corrupted
ovdb databases.

=item *

B<mailpost> now removes empty header fields before attempting to post
articles, and keeps trace of them in the X-Mailpost-Empty-Hdrs: newly
generated header field body.  Also, B<mailpost> now sanitizes header
fields with regards to empty continuation header lines.  Thanks to
Kamil Jonca for these bug reports.

=item *

A new B<-z> parameter has been added to B<mailpost> to mention a list
of header fields to remove from the gated message.  Thanks to Dieter
Stussy for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<inews> that was rejecting articles containing header
fields whose length exceeded 998 bytes.  This limitation is for the
length of a single line of a header field (and not for the length of
the whole header field, as it was wrongly the case).

=item *

Added support for GnuPG's B<gpg> binary (in addition to B<gpgv>)
in B<pgpverify>.  Indeed, B<gpg> still validates signatures made
with weak digest algorithms like MD5 whereas B<gpgv> no longer do.
Thanks to Thomas Hochstein for the patch, which permits validating
control articles for hierarchies that are still using old PGP keys.

=item *

Added similar support for GnuPG's B<gpg> binary in B<perl-nocem> to
validate NoCeM notices from issuers who are still using old PGP keys.

=item *

A few commands listed in the "Control commands to INND" section in
daily Usenet reports were appearing as a mere letter; all of them are
now properly converted to meaningful words.

=item *

The I<tlsprotocols> parameter in F<inn.conf> now recognizes the
C<TLSv1.3> value (for OpenSSL versions implementing S<TLS 1.3>, that
is to say starting from S<OpenSSL 1.1.1>).

=item *

The buffindexed overview method will now hopefully work properly on
systems with a native page size larger than 16KB.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.6.1

=over 2

=item *

B<nnrpd> now uses C<-0000> as the time zone for Date: and Injection-Date:
header fields it generates.  It was previously using C<+0000>, wrongly
systematically indicating a local time zone at Universal Time when
I<localtime> is set to false (which is the default) in F<readers.conf>.
The C<+0000> time zone will now be used only if I<localtime> is set to
true and UTC is really the local time zone of the server.

=item *

Julien Elie has implemented in B<nnrpd> the new COMPRESS command
described in draft-murchison-nntp-compress that extends the NNTP protocol
to allow a connection to be effectively and efficiently compressed.
News clients that also support that extension will be able to benefit
from that bandwidth optimization and improvement in speed.  Moreover,
using COMPRESS is more secure than TLS-level compression, as far as
authentication credentials are concerned.

=item *

The default value for the I<tlscompression> parameter in F<inn.conf>
has changed.  TLS-level compression is now disabled by default, to comply
with the best current practices for a secure use of TLS in application
protocols like NNTP.  Using the new COMPRESS command is recommended.

=item *

The I<tlscompression> parameter in F<inn.conf> now also permits
disabling TLS-level compression with S<OpenSSL 0.9.8>.  It previously
had an effect only when S<OpenSSL 1.0.0> or later was used.

=item *

B<rnews> no longer segfaults at startup when started setuid news.
Thanks to Marcus Jodorf for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed slow B<nnrpd> responses for a few NNTP commands.  The TCP_NODELAY
option was unconditionally set whereas only BSD/OS systems needed it.
Thanks to Christian Mock for having discovered that.

=item *

Articles containing a Received: or a Posted: header field are no longer
rejected by B<nnrpd> at injection time.

=item *

Articles containing control characters or whitespace-only content lines
in their headers are now rejected by B<nnrpd> at injection time.

=item *

S<OpenSSL 1.1.0> support has been added to INN.

=item *

When an encryption layer is negotiated during a successful use of the
STARTTLS command, or after a successful authentication using a SASL
mechanism that negotiates an encryption layer, B<nnrpd> now updates
the permissions of the news client according to the new secure state
of his connection (that is to say auth blocks in F<readers.conf> using
the I<require_ssl> parameter are taken into account).  Previously,
only connections on a dedicated port (usually 563) were taking benefit
from that parameter.  Thanks to Steve Crook for the bug report.

=item *

When a data integrity layer was negotiated during a successful SASL
authentication, B<nnrpd> was wrongly reseting any knowledge obtained
from the client, such as the current newsgroup and article number.
This behaviour now applies only when an encryption layer is negotiated.

=item *

B<nntpsend> now correctly waits until all of the child B<innxmit>
processes exit before it does.  It was causing B<nntpsend> to fail
to work properly on systems that use systemd, because when it exits
prematurely, systemd kills all of the processes it launched, including
the B<innxmit> processes.  Thanks to Jonathan Kamens for the patch.

=item *

Update from GNU Libtool 2.4.2 to 2.4.6.

=head1 Upgrading from 2.5 to 2.6

The following changes require your full attention because a manual
intervention may be needed:

=over 2

=item *

The name and location of the B<pullnews> configuration file have changed.
It is now F<pullnews.marks>, located in I<pathdb> when B<pullnews> is
run as the news user, or otherwise in the running user's home directory.
This file was previously stored in F<.pullnews> in the running user's
home directory (even for the news user).  If you use B<pullnews>, you
need to manually move and rename the configuration file; otherwise,
it will no longer work.  Note that the B<-c> flag passed to B<pullnews>
allows specifying another configuration file, if need be.

=item *

The default location of the B<mailpost> database directory has changed
from I<pathtmp> to I<pathdb>.  If you use B<mailpost> without an
explicitly specified database directory (using the B<-b> flag), then you
should manually move your current database files F<mailpost-msgid.dir>
and F<mailpost-msgid.pag> from I<pathtmp> to I<pathdb>.

=item *

If you have been using TLS/SSL with B<nnrpd> before, be aware that the
default value of a few F<inn.conf> parameters have changed:  the server
now decides the preferred cipher (instead of the client), and only TLS
protocols are allowed (using the flawed SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols is
now disabled).  If you want to change these settings, the respective
I<tlspreferserverciphers> and I<tlsprotocols> parameters can be tuned
to your needs.

=item *

The B<--with-kerberos> configure flag used to add S<Kerberos v5>
support has been renamed to B<--with-krb5>.

=item *

The B<--with-berkeleydb> configure flag used to add S<Berkeley DB>
support has been renamed to B<--with-bdb>.

=item *

The B<--enable-ipv6> configure flag no longer exists.  IPv6 is now
unconditionally enabled, if available.

=item *

$HOME is no longer exported as an environment variable by B<innshellvars>,
B<innshellvars.tcl> and the Perl module C<INN::Config>.  It was previously
overriding the default user home directory with I<pathnews>.  If you use
these scripts in your own scripts, you will have to take care of that change.

=item *

Owing to the implementation of S<RFC 4643> (AUTHINFO USER/PASS) in B<innd>,
if remote peers have to authenticate in order to feed articles, they now
have to send a username (which was previously wrongly optional), before
sending their password.  The mandatory username, though currently unused
by B<innd>, can be whatever the remote peer wishes.  In previous versions
of INN, B<inncheck> was already complaining when F<passwd.nntp> contained
an empty username associated with a password.

A manual review of authenticated feeds should then be done so as to ensure
that they are properly working.

=item *

The Injection-Date: and Injection-Info: headers are now generated by B<nnrpd>
at injection time instead of the NNTP-Posting-Date:, NNTP-Posting-Host:,
X-Complaints-To: and X-Trace: headers.  Local scripts that were using
(for authentication, privacy, etc.) these now deprecated headers should
be updated.  Also note that the Path: header of locally posted articles
can also contain the contents of the deprecated NNTP-Posting-Host: field.

=item *

The two I<addnntppostingdate> and I<addnntppostinghost> parameters in
F<inn.conf> have been respectively renamed to I<addinjectiondate> and
I<addinjectionpostinghost>.  B<innupgrade> takes care of the modification
only for F<inn.conf>; a manual change will therefore be needed for
F<readers.conf>, if these parameters are overridden in this file.

=item *

The default values of a few F<inn.conf> parameters have changed to make
use of the vastly expanded storage and RAM commonly available today:
datamovethreshold (from 8192 to 16384), msgidcachesize (from 16000
to 64000), overcachesize (from 64 to 128), and wireformat (now enabled
by default).

The generation of status reports and performance timings are now also
enabled by default:  logstatus and nnrpdoverstats parameters, with a
frequency of 10 minutes (status and timer parameters).

=item *

The default value of max-queue-size has changed from 5 to 20, and
use-mmap now defaults to true for F<innfeed.conf>.

=back

If you are upgrading from a version prior to S<INN 2.5>, see also
L<Upgrading from 2.4 to 2.5>.

=head1 Changes in 2.6.0

=over 2

=item *

The NNTP protocol requires a username to be sent before a password when
authentication is used.  B<innd> was wrongly allowing only a password to
be sent by authenticated peers.  See the note above for more details.

=item *

The Lines: header is no longer generated by B<nnrpd> at injection time.

=item *

The Injection-Date: header is now generated by B<nnrpd> at injection time
instead of the deprecated NNTP-Posting-Date: header, when I<addinjectiondate>
is set to true.  Note that I<addnntppostingdate> has been renamed to
I<addinjectiondate> in F<inn.conf>.

=item *

The Injection-Info: header is now generated by B<nnrpd> at injection time
instead of the deprecated NNTP-Posting-Host: (when I<addinjectionpostinghost>
is set to true), X-Complaints-To: and X-Trace: headers.  Note that
I<addnntppostinghost> has been renamed to I<addinjectionpostinghost>
in F<inn.conf>.  The Path: header of locally posted articles now also
contains the contents of the NNTP-Posting-Host: header.

=item *

A new I<addinjectionpostingaccount> parameter has been added in
F<inn.conf>.  When set to true, the Injection-Info: header field
contains an additional posting-account attribute that mentions the
username assigned to the user at connection time or after authentication.
The default value for this parameter is false.

=item *

A few headers are now considered as obsolete by B<nnrpd> at injection
time:  NNTP-Posting-Date:, NNTP-Posting-Host:, X-Complaints-To:, X-Trace:,
Also-Control:, Article-Names:, Article-Updates:, and See-Also: headers.

Besides, B<nnrpd> will similarly reject obsolete sendsys, senduuname and
version control messages.

=item *

The presence of a Subject: header field beginning with C<cmsg > no longer
causes an article to be interpreted as a control message by B<nnrpd>
at injection time.

=item *

B<nnrpd> no longer differentiates IHAVE from POST.  Articles injected
with IHAVE are now treated as though they were injected with POST.
It means that if the previous behaviour of IHAVE was expected, B<innd>
should handle itself the connection instead of B<nnrpd>.

=item *

The name of the B<pullnews> configuration file is now F<pullnews.marks>
located in I<pathdb> when B<pullnews> is run as the news user, or
otherwise in the running user's home directory.  It was previously
stored in F<.pullnews> in the running user's home directory (even for
the news user).

=item *

Fixed a leak of semaphores when using buffindexed.  Thanks to Richard
Kettlewell for having fixed the issue.

=item *

Building with Libtool is no longer optional.  The B<--enable-libtool>
option to B<configure> has been removed.

=item *

DESTDIR and non-root installs are now properly supported and documented
in INSTALL.  The C<make install>, C<make update> and C<make cert>
steps properly obey DESTDIR.  Besides, it is no longer a requirement
that the installation step be done by the superuser, as long as the
user executing the install has supplied a DESTDIR value that points
to a writable directory, I<and> the person or process performing the
install corrects the file ownerships when INN is installed on the system
on which it's going to run.  Thanks to James Ralston for this support.

=item *

When building INN with S<Berkeley DB>, Cyrus SASL, S<Kerberos
v5>, OpenSSL, or zlib support, no longer add standard locations to
compiler and linker include flags.  Such default paths are now added
only if explicitly given to one or more of the B<--with-bdb>,
B<--with-bdb-include>, B<--with-bdb-lib>, B<--with-sasl>,
B<--with-sasl-include>, B<--with-sasl-lib>, B<--with-krb5>,
B<--with-krb5-include>, B<--with-krb5-lib>, B<--with-openssl>,
B<--with-openssl-include>, B<--with-openssl-lib>, B<--with-zlib>,
B<--with-zlib-include>, or B<--with-zlib-lib> configure flags (the
flags ending with C<-include> and C<-lib> are new in S<INN 2.6.0>).

=item *

If the S<Berkeley DB>, Cyrus SASL, S<Kerberos v5>, or OpenSSL SSL
and crypto libraries are found at configure time, INN will now be
built with support for them unless respectively the B<--without-bdb>,
B<--without-sasl>, B<--without-krb5>, or B<--without-openssl> flags
are explicitly passed to configure.

Note that it was already the default behaviour for zlib support when
S<Berkeley DB> support was also enabled.

=item *

The configure flag B<--enable-reduced-depends> has been added to request
that library probes assume shared libraries are in use and dependencies
of libraries should not be probed.  It therefore tries to minimize the
shared library dependencies of the resulting binaries on platforms with
proper shared library dependencies.  This is not enabled by default, and
is of interest primarily to people building packages for distributions.

=item *

Building INN with Python support now requires the use of S<Python 2.2.0>
or later as the distutils.sysconfig module used was introduced with
S<Python 2.2.0>.

=item *

The INN test suite driver is now fully synchronized with the upstream
version of the C TAP Harness package maintained by Russ Allbery.
Keeping the INN test suite driver up-to-date will be possible thanks
to a new B<getc-tap-harness> script in the F<support> directory that
automatically fetches the latest upstream changes.

Similarly, the new B<getrra-c-util> script permits keeping most of
the utility and portability functions synchronized with the upstream
version of the rra-c-util package maintained by Russ Allbery.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.5.5

=over 2

=item *

New F<inn.conf> parameters used by B<nnrpd> to fine-tune the TLS/SSL
configuration have been added:  I<tlsciphers>, I<tlscompression>,
I<tlseccurve>, I<tlspreferserverciphers>, and I<tlsprotocols>.
Many thanks to Christian Mock for his contribution that permits
tightening the level of security provided by TLS/SSL.

=item *

B<innwatch> no longer creates a child process only for sleeping and then
waits on that process.  The forked-off process only died after it had
done sleeping, which caused the INN service to drop into maintenance
state when for instance running under SMF on illumos/Solaris (since
not all processes die within timeout).  Thanks to Lauri Tirkkonen for
the patch.

=item *

B<innd> no longer crashes if a channel is supposed to sleep but does not
define a waker callback function.  Also, the highest file descriptor of
sleeping channels is now properly updated.  Thanks to Petr Novopashenniy
for the bug report.

=item *

Add new B<-i> flag to both B<cnfsstat> and B<innwatch> to specify
how many seconds they should sleep at startup.  It will especially be
useful in B<rc.news> so that these scripts are actually started and then
sleep by themselves, instead of being started a minute after B<innd>
and therefore not being properly stopped if C<rc.news stop> is invoked
during that minute.

=item *

Add new B<-f> flag to B<innwatch> to specify the configuration file to
use, in case it is not the default F<innwatch.ctl> file.

=item *

Add new B<-t> flag to B<mailpost> to change, if needed, the default
directory to use to temporarily store error messages that are sent to
the newsmaster.  Two paths are now tried by default:  I<pathtmp> as
set in F<inn.conf>, and then F</var/tmp> if I<pathtmp> is not writable.

=item *

When the creation of a newsgroup needed expanding the tradindexed group
index, an already-running B<nnrpd> was not automatically noticing newly
created newsgroups.  Richard Kettlewell fixed that issue.

=item *

Fixed flushing of CNFS buffers when using NFS storage.

=item *

Fixed how B<innupgrade> is executed during an update of an INN
installation; on a few systems like AIX, it fails to run because its
taint mode was unproperly declared.

=item *

Several improvements have been contributed to B<pullnews> by Geraint
Edwards:  the new B<-a> flag adds the Diablo-compatible hashfeed
ability, the new B<-B> flag triggers header-only feeding, the B<-m>
flag now permits removing headers matching (or not) a given regexp,
and B<rnews> reporting is improved.

=item *

B<innreport> now properly takes into account the time B<nnrpd> spends
writing when using SASL.


=item *

B<scanlogs> now only shows the first 50 lines from error log files.
Otherwise, all of them were present verbatim in the daily report,
and the resulting e-mail could bounce owing to its length.  Thanks to
Jeffrey S<M. Vinocur> for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed the use of the legacy AUTHINFO GENERIC command, that has been
broken since S<INN 2.4.0> (therefore proving readers probably no longer
use that method to authenticate).  Thanks to Richard Kettlewell for
having noticed, though, and contributed to tighten the security of the
replies of this command.

=item *

Add the B<nnrp.access2readers.conf> contribution script written by
Jeffrey S<M. Vinocur> to convert old-style F<nnrp.access> file to
F<readers.conf>.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.5.4

=item *

An up-to-date F<control.ctl> file is provided with this release.  You should
manually update your F<control.ctl> file with the new information recorded
about Usenet hierarchies.

=item *

A test has been improved in F<innwatch.ctl> so that B<innwatch> no
longer throttles B<innd> when no overview directory exists.  You should
manually update your F<innwatch.ctl> file to get this improvement.

=item *

Fixed a long-standing limitation on how B<controlchan> and B<pgpverify>
were checking the signer of control messages.  They now properly handle
the case of several UIDs being defined on a single PGP key, as well
as the presence of spaces into UIDs.  In previous versions of INN,
a few valid control messages got ignored because of that limitation
(fido.ger.* and grisbi.* were for instance impacted).

=item *

As the name of the F<radius.conf> configuration file shipped with INN
for the B<nnrpd> authenticator against a RADIUS server conflicts with
the libradius package, this file is renamed to F<inn-radius.conf>
(B<innupgrade> takes care of the rename during the update).

=item *

The attributes hash is now accessible to B<nnrpd> Perl posting filter.
As a result, F<filter_nnrpd.pl> can make use of it.  Only authentication
and access Perl hooks could previously use the attributes hash.
Thanks to Steve Crook for this addition.

=item *

INN now properly builds fine with S<< B<flex> 2.5.36 >> (this version
introduced a change of type for a variable used by INN).

=item *

When using funnel feeds, B<innfeed> log files were open forever, which
resulted in empty log files, once rotated by B<scanlogs>.  B<innfeed>
now reopens its log files upon receiving a HUP signal; this signal
is in particular sent by B<scanlogs> during log rotation.  Thanks to
Florian Schlichting for the patch.

=item *

Exploder and process channels are now reopened when C<ctlinnd flushlogs>
is used.  Otherwise, they could hold open an already deleted F<errlog>
file.  The issue affected in particular B<controlchan> or B<ninpaths>,
running as such channels.

=item *

Fixed a buffer overflow when using B<imapfeed> with more than a million
commands during the same IMAP session.  Thanks to David Binderman for
the bug report.

=item *

Fixed a segfault occurring in B<innd> on systems where time_t is a
64-bit integer.  Thanks to S<S.P. Zeidler> for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a segfault occurring in B<nnrpd> when a res block was used in
F<readers.conf> without the program: key.

=item *

Fixed an issue where users were denied posting because of an overlapping
buffer copy in a check B<nnrpd> was doing.  Thanks to Florian Schlichting
for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a regression that occurred in S<INN 2.5.3> regarding the path used
by default by B<pullnews> for its configuration file.  Instead of looking
in the running user's home directory, it was looking in the I<pathnews>
directory set in F<inn.conf>.  Thanks to Tony Evans for the bug report.

=item *

When neither B<wget> nor B<ncftpget> nor B<ncftp> was found at configure
time, the path to the B<simpleftp> substitution program shipped with
INN was not properly set in B<innshellvars>, B<innshellvars.pl>, and
the C<INN::Config> Perl module.  Thanks to Christian Garbs for the
bug report.

=item *

B<ckpasswd> no longer tries to use the ndbm compatibility layer provided
by S<Berkeley DB> if S<Berkeley DB> has been built without ndbm support.
Also add support for gdbm libraries in B<ckpasswd>.

=item *

Fixed a Perl warning in B<inncheck>; using C<defined(@array)> has been
deprecated since S<Perl 5.16>.

=item *

Fixed the occurrence of an unexpected C<cant select> error generated by
B<innd>.  Thanks to Paul Tomblin for having caught that long-standing
issue.

=item *

When building INN with S<Berkeley DB> support, no longer add
F<-L/usr/lib> to the linker include flags; unconditionally adding it
may break the build on systems using lib32 and lib64 directories.

=item *

On a fresh INN install, F<motd.innd> and F<motd.nnrpd> are no longer
installed by default.  Instead, samples for these files are provided
in I<pathetc>, named differently so that their default contents are
not displayed to news clients before they get customised.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements (like the addition
in the F<readers.conf> man page of the log: and program: parameters in
res blocks, and the include directive).

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.5.3

Please note that the HTML_STATUS compile-time option has been replaced
with the I<htmlstatus> parameter in F<inn.conf>.  If you used HTML_STATUS,
you should set I<htmlstatus> accordingly.

A confusion in the name of a key in F<innfeed.conf> existed in the source
code.  Make sure that the misspelled, undocumented I<backlog-limit-high>
key is *not* used in your F<innfeed.conf> file; its real name is
I<backlog-limit-highwater>.  You should rename the key in case it is present
in your configuration file.  Otherwise, it will not be taken into account.
You can run B<inncheck> to verify that the syntax of this file is correct.

It is generally recommended to run B<inncheck> after any changes done to
configuration files, especially with the new improved version of this script
shipped with S<INN 2.5.3>, thanks to the hard work of Florian Schlichting
who added support for the syntax of F<incoming.conf>, F<innfeed.conf>,
F<readers.conf> and F<storage.conf>.

An up-to-date F<control.ctl> file is provided with this release.  You should
manually update your F<control.ctl> file with the new information recorded
about Usenet hierarchies.

When HDR/XHDR/XPAT were used on a new article coming into a newsgroup,
requesting a header not present in the overview database, the first
subsequent OVER/XOVER command did not show that article.  A remap of the
overview data file was missing in B<nnrpd>.  Thanks to Sam Varshavchik
for the bug report.

=item *

When a header field appeared more than once in an article, it was missing
from the overview data.  OVER/XOVER, as well as HDR/XHDR/XPAT using the
overview, were therefore returning an empty field.  The content of the
first occurrence is now returned, in accordance with S<RFC 3977>.

Perl and Python filters for B<innd> now also properly initialize their
header variables with the first occurrence of header fields.  (It is
still the last occurrence for the Perl filter for B<nnrpd>.)

=item *

Fixed a possible plaintext command injection during the negotiation
of a TLS layer.  The vulnerability detailed in CVE-2011-0411 (and
CVE-2012-3523, specifically for INN) affects the STARTTLS and AUTHINFO
SASL commands.  B<nnrpd> now resets its read buffer upon a successful
negotiation of a TLS layer.  It prevents malicious commands, sent
unencrypted, from being executed in the new encrypted state of the
session.

=item *

Fixed a regression that occurred in S<INN 2.5.0> when leading whitespace
characters have been made significant in header field bodies.  It could
lead INN to drop articles and throttle itself when running as a slave
because Xref: header fields generated by other news servers, or even S<INN
2.4.6>, could contain (valid) leading whitespace.  Thanks to Matija Nalis
for having caught this bug.

=item *

Fixed an invalid C<431> response to CHECK commands when B<innd> is paused:
the message-ID of the article to defer was missing.  Also fixed another
issue in the messages B<innd> replied; when an error occurred during a
write on a channel, a trailing extra junk byte was added to the reply.
Thanks to River Tarnell for these bug reports.

=item *

It is now possible to properly generate daily statistics with B<sendinpaths>
thanks to the new B<-k> and B<-r> flags that permit controlling the interval
of days for processing dump files.  The new B<-c> flag permits sending a
copy of the generated e-mail to the newsmaster.

Also fixed an issue with statistics that could be missing or duplicated
for a couple of days when monthly sent.

The documentation has been updated and mentions a preferred daily run of
B<sendinpaths>.  This script is a complete rewrite in Perl, and is based
on Mohan Kokal's initial work.

=item *

B<cnfsheadconf> now properly recognizes continuation lines in
F<cycbuff.conf>, that is to say lines ending with a backslash (C<\>).
Thanks to John S<F. Morse> for the bug report.

=item *

The order of CNFS buffers in a metacycbuff is now properly read and written
by B<cnfsheadconf>.  There previously was a confusion between hexadecimal
and decimal values.  Thanks again to John S<F. Morse>.

=item *

When the B<-l> flag is given to B<cnfsstat>, the F<cycbuff.conf> and
F<storage.conf> files are now reloaded if they have been modified since
the previous output of B<cnfsstat>.

=item *

A single header field line is limited to 998 bytes, per S<RFC 5536>.  B<innd>
was previously accepting, and also generating Xref: header field lines,
up to 1022 bytes.  Now, B<nnrpd> (acting as an injecting agent) rejects
articles which contain header field lines whose length exceeds 998 bytes.
And B<innd> (acting as a relaying or serving agent) no longer checks that.

=item *

B<nnrpd> advertises the COUNTS, DISTRIBUTIONS, MODERATORS, MOTD and
SUBSCRIPTIONS variants of the LIST command in response to CAPABILITIES.
These commands already existed in B<nnrpd> but S<RFC 6048> had not yet
been published.

=item *

Add support for LIST MOTD in B<innd>.  Consequently, the F<motd.news>
configuration file which was previously used only by B<nnrpd> is renamed
to F<motd.nnrpd> (B<innupgrade> takes care of the rename).  B<innd> uses
the new F<motd.innd> file in I<pathetc> for its message of the day.

=item *

Fixed an issue at configure time that made INN wrongly assume that OpenBSD
(4.6) didn't support Unix-domain sockets.  Thanks to Wim Lewis for the patch.

=item *

Fixed an issue on systems which do not have a working flock(2) function
(Solaris, for instance).  B<mailpost> and B<pullnews> are reported not to
be usable on such systems.  Many thanks to Dennis Davis for the bug report.

A wrapper around B<shlock> is now called in Perl scripts.  The
INN::Utils::Shlock module has been added for that use.

=item *

Fixed an issue in the Python access hook for B<nnrpd>:  it has not been
working since S<Python 2.5> on 64-bit platforms, owing to a change to
Python's C API, using a new Py_ssize_t type definition instead of int.
Thanks to Raphael Barrois for the patch.

=item *

Improve the stability of the Perl filters for B<innd> and B<nnrpd>:
properly save and restore the stack pointer when needed.

=item *

The Injection-Date: header, when present, is now used by B<innd> and
B<makehistory> to determine the posting date of an article.  Otherwise,
the Date: header is used.

=item *

B<controlchan> now imposes a date cutoff on processing control articles.
The I<artcutoff> parameter set in F<inn.conf> is used.  Otherwise, without
that cutoff, old control articles could be maliciously reinjected into
Usenet, and replayed.  (An unsigned Injection-Date: header field could be
added to an article that only had a Date: header field.)  A new B<-c> flag
has been added to B<controlchan> to disable the cutoff check, if needed
(usually when manually invoking the program).

=item *

B<nnrpd> no longer adds or updates the Path: header field when an article is
forwarded to a moderator.  It could otherwise lead to rejects at injection
time when the article was approved by the moderator.

=item *

The X-Trace: header field was not properly generated when an article
was locally posted.  The field mentioning the IP address was skipped,
resulting in a wrong syntax for this header.  The local "127.0.0.1" IP
address is now used.  Besides, C<localhost> is now mentioned instead of
an obscure C<stdin> in injection header fields.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the frequency B<innfeed> logs its status:  too many useless
lines were written to F<news.notice>.  Thanks to Florian Schlichting for
the fix.

=item *

When unset in F<innfeed.conf>, the I<dynamic-method> parameter now
properly defaults to C<3> (instead of C<0>) and I<use-mmap> to false
(instead of true).  These two values were already the recommended ones in
the documentation and the sample file.  Note that I<use-mmap> is only used
when B<innfeed> is given file names to send instead of storage API tokens,
which is a fairly rare use case.

=item *

B<innfeed> no longer generates an error message (logged in F<news.err>) when
a parameter is not defined in F<innfeed.conf>.  All the parameters have a
default value, so there is no need to warn the user if they are not present
in F<innfeed.conf>.  Thanks to Dieter Stussy for having reported this problem.

=item *

Implement an upper limit to the number of file descriptors B<innd>
can handle.  At most (FD_SETSIZE-1) file descriptors can be used.  This
upper limit now overrides any superior number set with I<rlimitnofile>
in F<inn.conf>.  Thanks to Steve Crook for the bug report.

=item *

A default timeout on outgoing sockets (using NNTPconnect) has been added
by Florian Schlichting.  For a long time, there have been occasional
problems with B<actsync> (and probably other programs) that would hang
until manually killed or restarted.

=item *

The flag B<-S> has been added to B<innd> by Florian Schlichting.  When used,
B<innd> reports the errors found in F<incoming.conf> and exits.

=item *

B<pullnews> no longer stops processing newsgroups when an error occur during
its run (for instance when a newsgroup mentioned in the configuration file
is removed from an upstream server).  Besides, it can now use authentication
when posting to the downstream server.

A few other minor bugs have been fixed as for the way B<pullnews> counts
the articles.

=item *

Fixed the way B<innreport> handles leap years.  It now properly generates
HTML reports; dates were assumed to be relative to the current year, which
may break their computation during for instance the whole 2012 leap year.
Please note that no HTML reports have been lost, and that they will appear
when INN is updated to this new version.

=item *

A new parameter has been added to F<inn.conf> to determine whether the status
file that B<innd> can write out (depending on the value of the I<status>
parameter) is plain text or wrapped in HTML.  It previously only was a
compile-time option, set to true by default.  Florian Schlichting added
the I<htmlstatus> parameter to provide a configurable behaviour.

=item *

It is now possible to run a script at the end of the execution of
B<innshellvars> scripts.  If a file named F<innshellvars.local>,
F<innshellvars.pl.local> or F<innshellvars.tcl.local> is present and
executable in I<pathetc>, then it will be executed by the corresponding
B<innshellvars> script (respectively shell, INN::Config Perl module,
and Tcl).  A typical use is to add or override variables.

=item *

Add support for wire-formatted articles in B<scanspool>.

=item *

A lot of work on cleaning old perl4-style code has been done by Florian
Schlichting.

=item *

B<inncheck> now generates a proper non-zero exit value when errors are found,
and allows quiet mode with the B<-q> flag.  Florian Schlichting has greatly
improved this script in many regards, especially with a config-syntax parser
for F<incoming.conf>, F<innfeed.conf>, F<readers.conf> and F<storage.conf>.

=item *

B<inncheck> now properly finds the boundaries of substituted variables in
F<newsfeeds> thanks to Alexander Bartolich.

=item *

B<docheckgroups> no longer uses awk.  On a few systems, the script was
failing because of the presence of an old version of awk that has a limit
in the size of the input it can handle.  Processing large newsgroups files
was consequently impossible.  B<docheckgroups> now uses Perl instead of awk,
which solves the issue reported by S<John F. Morse>.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements.  In particular, the
I<debug-shrinking>, I<fast-exit> and I<initial-sleep> keys in F<innfeed.conf>
are now documented.  The function C<filter_end()>, called when Perl filtering
is turned off, is also documented for the B<innd> and B<nnrpd> Perl filters.

=head1 Changes in 2.5.2

The way checkpoints are handled by B<innreport> for B<innd> and B<innfeed>
has totally changed to provide more accurate daily statistics.  The first
Usenet report after an upgrade to S<INN 2.5.2> will probably contain
incorrect statistics for incoming and outgoing articles because the
beginning of the log files that will be used was generated by a previous
version of INN.

A new version of F<innreport.conf> is shipped with S<INN 2.5.2> but, in
order to preserve any local changes, will not be automatically installed
with make update.  The changes are minor and not mandatory for the
upgrade.

=over 2

=item *

Julien Elie has implemented in B<innd> the new version of the NNTP
protocol described in S<RFC 3977>, S<RFC 4643> and S<RFC 4644>, and
B<innd> now recognizes the CAPABILITIES command.  Despite these standards,
three commands (IHAVE, CHECK and TAKETHIS) will continue, for
interoperability reasons, to return a reject code (respectively C<435>,
C<438>, and C<439>) when the command contains a syntax error instead of
C<501>.  The mandatory username argument for authenticated peers is not
enforced in S<INN 2.5.2> but will be be enforced by S<INN 2.6.0> when it
is released.

Major improvements are:

=over 2

=item *

B<innd> now has a decent parser for NNTP commands.  The parser is more
correct (commands like C<< IHAVEZ<><mid> >>, without a space between the
command and its argument, are no longer valid) and allows leading and
trailing whitespaces in commands.  B<innd> also now checks the length of
the NNTP command sent by the client.  If the command contains more than
512 bytes (or 497 bytes for an argument), an error is returned and the
command is discarded.  After ten unrecognized commands, B<innd> closes the
connection with the appropriate code (C<400> instead of C<500>).

=item *

The output of the HELP command specifies the arguments expected by NNTP
commands, similar to B<nnrpd>'s HELP command.

=item *

LIST ACTIVE, LIST ACTIVE.TIMES and LIST NEWSGROUPS now allow an optional
wildmat argument to restrict the results of those commands to specific
newsgroups.

=item *

When using HEAD or STAT with an article number or a range, C<412> (no
group selected) is now returned instead of C<501> (syntax error).

=back

=item *

Jeffrey S<M. Vinocur> has implemented support in both B<innd> and B<nnrpd>
for whitespace in usernames/passwords provided with AUTHINFO USER/PASS.
They were previously treated as invalid arguments or incorrectly parsed.
B<innd> and B<nnrpd> now treat everything after the first whitespace
character following AUTHINFO USER/PASS, up to, but not including, the
final CRLF, as the username/password, in conformity with S<RFC 4643>.

=item *

The syntax of message-IDs is now based on S<RFC 5536> (USEFOR) instead of
S<RFC 1036>.  The major change is that quoted-pairs have been removed from
the syntax.

=item *

The Perl and Python filters for B<innd> now check the message-ID of
articles arriving through TAKETHIS.  Only CHECK and IHAVE commands
previously used them.

=item *

Case-insensitive matches are now used for distributions, path identities,
IMAP commands, header names, and control commands.  (Newsgroups are still
matched case-sensitively.)  Message-IDs are case-sensitively matched,
except for history hashes.

=item *

The new Archive:, Archive-At:, Comments:, and Summary: header fields
defined in S<RFC 5064> and S<RFC 5536> can be used in B<innd> filters.
B<nnrpd> now checks at injection time that an article does not contain an
Injection-Info: header, that an Injection-Date: header (if provided) is
valid, and that the Path: header does not contain C<.POSTED>.  Note that
INN does not yet generate these two injection fields or include the new
Path: header field C<.POSTED> keyword.  These new features will be in the
next major release of INN.

=item *

LIST SUBSCRIPTIONS now accepts an optional wildmat argument to restrict
the results of this command to specific newsgroups.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now supports a new LIST variant named COUNTS.  LIST COUNTS is a
combination of LIST ACTIVE and GROUP.  It returns the same result as LIST
ACTIVE except that the number of articles in a newsgroup is inserted
before its status.

=item *

A new flag has been added to F<newsfeeds> entries: C<Aj>, when present,
says to feed articles accepted and filed in C<junk> (due to I<wanttrash>)
to peers based on their F<newsfeeds> feed patterns applied to the
Newsgroups: header as though the article were accepted and all those
groups were locally carried.  This is useful if you want to run INN with a
minimal F<active> file and propagate all posts.  Thanks to Andrew Gierth
for the patch.

=item *

A new parameter has been added to F<inn.conf>: I<logtrash> defines whether
a line for articles posted to groups not locally carried by the news
server should be added in the F<news> log file to report unwanted
newsgroups.  The default is true but it can be useful to set it to false
(especially when I<wanttrash> is also used).

=item *

The B<procbatchdir> keyword has been added to B<news.daily> to specify the
backlog directory of B<innfeed>.  This is useful when several instances of
B<innfeed> are running or when its configuration file is not the default
one.

=item *

B<sm> now supports a new flag, B<-c>, which shows a decoded form of the
storage API token.  This was previously done by the contrib B<showtoken>
script developed by Olaf Titz and Marco d'Itri.

=item *

The B<O> flag in F<newsfeeds> now relies on the contents of the
Injection-Info: header field if it is present to determine the origin of
an article.  It falls back on X-Trace: if there is no Injection-Info:
header field.

=item *

A new "unsigned long" type bas been added to the configuration parser.  It
will properly warn the news administrator when a variable supposed to be
positive contains a negative integer.  It will prevent INN from crashing
due to misconfiguration at several places where it did not expect negative
values.

=item *

B<innxbatch> and B<innxmit> now recognize the new C<403> code introduced
by S<RFC 3977> for a problem preventing the requested action from being
taken.

=item *

HDR and OVER commands now return the correct C<423> code (instead of
C<420>) when the current article number is used but the article no longer
exists.

=item *

B<actsync>, B<inews>, B<innxbatch>, B<innxmit>, B<nntpget> and B<rnews>
can now authenticate to news servers which only expect a username, without
password, conforming to S<RFC 4643>.

=item *

The keyword generation code now generates a Keywords: header only if the
original article does not already have one.  The generated Keywords:
header no longer begins with a comma.  If keyword generation is set to
true in F<inn.conf> but the Keywords: header is not stored in the
overview, the news administrator is warned and keyword generation
deactivated, since it exists only to populate the overview data.

=item *

Two segfaults in keyword generation were fixed.  The first occurred when
an article already had a Keywords: header longer than the I<keylimit>
parameter.  The second was caused by a possible invalid pointer beyond the
newly allocated Keywords: header.

=item *

Fixed B<innd> handling of empty lines.  B<innd> was not properly
discarding an empty command and was closing the connection when it
received only whitespace in a command.

=item *

Fixed a bug in how B<innd> responded to reader commands when readers were
not allowed.  A superfluous blank line was sent in its response.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<innd>'s response to TAKETHIS when authentication is
required.  Previously, C<480> code was returned immediately without
accepting the multi-line data block first, which broke synchronization in
the NNTP protocol.

=item *

Fixed a bug in recognizing the article terminator when empty articles were
fed to B<innd> via IHAVE or TAKETHIS, leading to treating subsequent NNTP
commands as part of the article.

=item *

When B<innd> could not provide information for LIST ACTIVE.TIMES and LIST
NEWSGROUPS, it was returning an invalid error message without a response
code.  The proper C<503> answer code is now returned.

=item *

When an unauthenticated user tried to post an article, B<nnrpd> replied
C<440> (posting not allowed) instead of the correct C<480> (authentication
required) response if the user might be able to post after authentication.
Thanks to Daniel Weber for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed a bug in both B<innd> and B<nnrpd> answers to LIST commands where
the output was not checked for valid dot stuffing.

=item *

Fixed a bug leading to junked non-control articles being sent to
control-only feeds, and also fixed handling of poisoned control groups.
Thanks to Andrew Gierth for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<innreport> leading to incorrect summing of B<innd> stats
when I<hostname> was set to an IPv6 address instead of a fully qualified
domain name.  Thanks to Petr Novopashenniy for the bug report.

=item *

Changed how B<innreport> uses B<innd> and B<innfeed> checkpoint messages.
Previously, connections held open for multiple days led to skewed and
incorrect statistics on how many articles had been received or sent.  The
count is now more accurate and, for each connection of a feed, only
depends on I<incominglogfrequency> in F<inn.conf> and I<stats-period> in
F<innfeed.conf>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<nnrpd> Perl filter: a header field whose name begins with
the name of a standardized header field was not properly handled.

=item *

Fixed a bug in how B<innd> was parsing Message-ID: and Supersedes: headers
which contained trailing whitespace.  The article was corrupted by an
unexpected "\r" in the middle of the header.  B<nnrpd> now checks the
syntax of the Message-ID: header field, if present.

=item *

Fixed various bugs in how leading whitespace was treated in headers.  The
HDR, XHDR and XPAT commands were not properly showing leading whitespace
in header values.  Lone "\n" and "\r" characters are now changed into
spaces and "\r\n" is just removed.  B<archive>, B<makehistory>, and
B<tdx-util> now keep leading whitespace in headers when generating
overview data, and B<archive> now changes "\n" (when not preceded by "\r")
into a space when generating overview data.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the generation of overview data which may corrupt
previously generated overview data when a pseudo Xref: header field is
injected in an extra overview field.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the parsing of the I<ovgrouppat> wildmat in F<inn.conf>
that prevented overview data from being generated when poisoned groups
were specified but a latter sub-pattern matched the group.  A uwildmat
expression is now correctly handled, and a potential segfault has been
fixed.  Thanks to Dieter Stussy for the bug report.

=item *

Fixed a bug when HDR, XHDR and XPAT were used when I<virtualhost> was set
to true in F<readers.conf>.  The Xref: header of articles posted to only
one newsgroup appeared empty.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<tdx-util> in parsing empty overview fields when called
with B<-A> or B<-F>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<cvtbatch>, which was returning only the size of the
headers of an article when the C<b> parameter was used with the B<-w>
flag.  It now correctly returns the size of the whole article, which is
what C<b> was documented to do.  B<cvtbatch> also has a new C<t>
parameter, which can be used with the B<-w> flag to retrieve the arrival
time of an article.

=item *

Fixed a bug in how B<mailpost> handles cross-posting feature.  It was not
properly detaching from B<sendmail>.  Thanks to Harald Dunkel for the
patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the F<newsfeeds> B<C> flag: the count of followup groups
was one less than the real number.  When the value of the Followup-To:
header field is C<poster>, it is no longer considered to be a followup.
Thanks to Dieter Stussy for the patch.

=item *

When using tradindexed, the overview data for a cancelled article is now
immediately removed from the overview.  Thanks to Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen
for the patch.

=item *

B<batcher> has not supported the retrieval of an article with its file
name for a long time.  The B<-S> flag has therefore been removed.

=item *

B<inews> no longer rejects articles that contain more than 50 header
fields.  Thanks to Torsten Jerzembeck for the bug report.

=item *

B<news.daily> no longer sends superfluous mails when the B<nomail> keyword
is given.  Mail is only sent when there is real output.  Previously, there
would always be headings and empty lines left over from the structuring of
the full report, which are now omitted.  Also, the output of programs
executed with B<postexec> is now included in the regular mail.  Thanks to
Florian Schlichting for the patch.

=item *

B<innconfval> no longer maps NULL string or list values to an empty string
or list and instead maps them to undefined values.  This fixes an issue
reported by Kamil Jonca: B<nnrpd> was inserting an empty Organization:
header when the I<organization> parameter in F<inn.conf> was unset.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements.

=head1 Changes in 2.5.1

=over 2

=item *

Fixed a segfault in B<imap_connection> which could occur when SASL
was used.

=item *

Fixed a segfault in the keyword generation code which was assuming
that an article was nul-terminated.  Fixed another segfault in the
keyword generation code when an article already contained a
Keywords: header.  Thanks to Nix for the bug reports.

=item *

Owing to the US-CERT vulnerability note VU#238019, Cyrus SASL library
has slightly changed.  B<imap_connection> and B<nnrpd> now handle
that change.  Otherwise, some answers are too long to be properly
computed during SASL exchanges.

=item *

Fixed a memory allocation problem which caused B<nnrpd> to die when
retrieving via HDR/XHDR/XPAT the contents of an extra overview field
absent from the headers of an article.  The NEWNEWS command was also
affected on very rare cases.  Thanks to Tim Woodall for the bug report.

=item *

HDR/XHDR/XPAT answers are now robust when the overview database is
inconsistent.  When the overview schema was modified without the overview
database being rebuilt, wrong results could be returned for extra fields
(especially a random portion of some other header).  The desired header
name is now explicitly searched for in the overview information.

=item *

Fixed the source which is logged to the F<news> log file for local
postings when the local server is not listed in F<incoming.conf>.
A wrong name was used, taken amongst known peers.  The source is now
logged as C<localhost>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the timecaf storage method:  only the first 65535 articles
could be retrievable in a CAF, though everything was properly stored.  (A
Crunched Article File contains all the articles that arrive to the news
server during 256 seconds.)

The storage token now uses 4 bytes to store the article sequence number
for timecaf, instead of only 2 bytes.  Thanks to Kamil Jonca for the
bug report and also the patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug in both timecaf and timehash which prevented them from working
on systems where short ints were not 16-bit integers.

=item *

When there is not enough space to write an entire CAF header, the timecaf
storage manager now uses a larger blocksize.  On 32-bit systems, the CAF header
is about 300 bytes, leaving about 200 bytes for the free bitmap index
(the remaining of a 512-byte blocksize).  On 64-bit systems, the size
of the CAF header could exceed 512 bytes, thus leaving no room for the
free bitmap index.  A S<1 KB> blocksize is then used, or a larger
size if need be.

=item *

A new CNFS version has been introduced by Miquel van Smoorenburg in
the CNFS header.  CNFSv4 uses S<4 KB> blocks instead of S<512 bytes>,
which more particularly makes writes faster.  CNFSv4 supports
files/partitions up to S<16 TB> with a S<4 KB> blocksize.

Existing CNFS buffers are kept unchanged; only new CNFS buffers are
initialized with that new version.

=item *

B<grephistory -l> now returns the contents of the expires history field
as well as the hash of the message-ID.  Besides, when the storage API
token does not exist, B<grephistory -v> now also returns the hash
of the requested message-ID.

=item *

The check on cancel messages when I<verifycancels> is set to true
in F<inn.conf> has been changed to verify that at least one newsgroup
in the cancel message can be found in the article to be cancelled.
This new feature is from Christopher Biedl.

The previous behaviour was to check whether the cancel message is
from the same person as the original post, which is extremely easy
to spoof; besides, S<RFC 5537> (USEPRO) mentions that "cancel control
messages are not required to contain From: and Sender: header fields
matching the target message.  This requirement only encouraged cancel
issuers to conceal their identity and provided no security".

=item *

The way the C</remember/> line in F<expire.ctl> works has changed.
History retention for an article was done according to its original
arrival time; it is now according to its original posting date.
Otherwise, unnecessary data may be kept too long in the F<history>
file.

To achieve that, the HISremember() function in history API now
expects a fourth parameter:  the article posting time.

Note that article expiration has not changed and is still based
on arrival time, unless the B<-p> flag is passed to B<expire>
or B<expireover>, in which case posting time is used.

=item *

The default value for C</remember/> has changed from C<10> to C<11>
because it should be one more than the I<artcutoff> parameter
in F<inn.conf>, so that articles posted one day into the future
are properly retained in history.

=item *

B<auth_krb5> has been rewritten by Russ Allbery to use modern
Kerberos APIs.  Note that using B<ckpasswd> with PAM support
and a Kerberos PAM module instead of this authenticator is still
recommended.

=item *

A new B<-L> flag has been added by Jonathan Kamens to B<makehistory>
so as to specify a load average limit.  If the system load average exceeds
the specified limit, B<makehistory> sleeps until it goes below the limit.

=item *

As UTF-8 is the default character set in S<RFC 3977>, C<ctlinnd pause>,
C<ctlinnd readers>, C<ctlinnd reject>, C<ctlinnd reserve>, C<ctlinnd throttle>
and C<nnrpd -r> commands now require the given reason to be encoded in UTF-8,
so that it can be properly sent to news readers.  The creator's name given
to C<ctlinnd newgroup> is also expected to be encoded in UTF-8.

=item *

The output of consistency checks for article storage and the F<history>
file no longer appears by default when C<cnfsstat -a> is used.  A new B<-v>
flag has been added to B<cnfsstat> so as to see it.

=item *

The default path for TLS certificates has changed from I<pathnews>/lib
to I<pathetc>.  It only affects new INN installations or generations of
certificates with C<make cert>.  Besides, a default value has been
added to I<tlscapath> because it is required by B<nnrpd> when TLS
is used.

=item *

gzip(1) is now the default UUCP batcher in B<send-uucp> instead of
compress(1) because B<gzip> is more widely available than B<compress>,
due to old patent issues.  Note that there is no impact on decompression
as it is handled by B<rnews>.

=item *

B<cnfsheadconf> now uses the Perl core module C<Math::BigInt> rather
than the deprecated F<bigint.pl> library.  When used without specifying
a CNFS buffer, it now properly displays the status of all CNFS buffers.

=back

=head1 Upgrading from 2.4 to 2.5

The following changes require your full attention because a manual intervention
may be needed:

=over 2

=item *

In order to process control messages, B<controlchan> now needs the
C<MIME::Parser> module.  Packages are available from most distributions,
or you can install the module directly from CPAN (C<MIME-tools> in
F<modules/by-module/MIME/>, for instance on ftp.perl.org).

S<Perl 5.8.0> or later is recommended for INN.  If you are using an earlier
version, you will also need the C<Encode> module for correct processing of
control messages.  (It is included with Perl itself in 5.8.0 and later.)

=item *

Checkgroups control messages are now differently handled by B<controlchan>:
all matching lines in F<control.ctl> will be used for a given checkgroups
and a B<doit> action will really be executed (adding, removing and changing
the status of newsgroups).  You should make sure that your local
configuration does not rely on the previous behaviour of only mailing
changes, without actually performing them.

=item *

You should use the new F<control.ctl.local> file shipped with INN in
I<pathetc> and, at the same time, update your F<control.ctl> and
F<moderators> files.  Also make sure that your F<active.times>,
F<distrib.pats> and F<newsgroups> files are properly encoded in UTF-8, as
it is strongly recommended by S<RFC 3977>.

=item *

The F<overview.fmt> file is no longer used by INN.  Two new parameters
have been added to F<inn.conf>:  I<extraoverviewadvertised> and
I<extraoverviewhidden>.  Although B<innupgrade> takes care of the
change during C<make update>, you should make sure that your overview
database is consistent with all the fields declared in F<overview.fmt>
because they will all be advertised, and C<Xref:full> forced as the
eighth overview field.  See the inn.conf(5) man page for more information
about these parameters.

=item *

The B<innreport> configuration file has slightly changed.  The new
F<innreport.conf> file shipped with INN should be used and your possible
changes backported to this new version.

=item *

The $SPOOLBASE variable has been renamed to $SPOOLDIR in B<innshellvars>
in order to be more consistent.  It impacts shell scripts only.  If you
import B<innshellvars> and use that variable in your scripts, you will
have to rename it.

=item *

B<gpgverify> is no longer included in INN, B<pgpverify> now has better
support for GnuPG and should be used instead.

=item *

The B<auth_smb> authenticator program to check passwords with an SMB
authentication is no longer included in INN.  It was a stripped-down
version of pam_smbpass, wasn't maintained, and likely had security
problems.  To authenticate to an SMB server such as Samba, use PAM and
B<ckpasswd>'s PAM support instead.

=back

The parameters used by B<nnrpd> to provide TLS support are now
I<tlscafile>, I<tlscapath>, I<tlscertfile> and I<tlskeyfile> in
F<inn.conf>.  The F<sasl.conf> file used for that in previous versions of
INN is obsolete.  B<innupgrade> takes care of the change during C<make
update>.

The I<nntpactsync> parameter has been renamed to I<incominglogfrequency>
in F<inn.conf>; B<innupgrade> handles this renaming during the update.

In F<newsfeeds>, B<innfeed> should be run directly rather than through
B<startinnfeed>.  B<innupgrade> will attempt to take care of this
modification during C<make update>.

When starting B<innd> by hand, B<innd> can just be run directly rather
than using B<inndstart>.  If you get error messages about resetting the
file descriptor limits, you may need to increase the file descriptor
limits.  See the sample init script in F<contrib> for an example of how to
do this.

If you are upgrading from a version prior to S<INN 2.4>, see also
L<Upgrading from 2.3 to 2.4>.

=head1 Changes in 2.5.0

=over 2

=item *

Ken Murchison has contributed SASL authentication support for B<nnrpd>,
implementing the AUTHINFO SASL section of S<RFC 4643>.  If the
B<--with-sasl> option is given to C<configure>, B<nnrpd> will be able to
authenticate clients via secure SASL mechanisms.

=item *

Julien Elie has implemented in B<nnrpd> the new version of the NNTP
protocol described in S<RFC 3977>, S<RFC 4642> and S<RFC 4643>.
Consequently, B<nnrpd> now recognizes the CAPABILITIES command, the
HDR and LIST HEADERS commands, the second optional argument to specify
a range of articles to LISTGROUP, the OVER command, as well as the
C<:bytes> and C<:lines> metadata items.

=item *

Heath Kehoe has added the ability to compress overview data before
it is stored in ovdb.  It significantly improves the performance
of this storage method and reduces the time spent by B<expireover>.
See the new B<--with-zlib> option to C<configure> and the ovdb(5)
man page.

=item *

Alexander Bartolich has greatly improved B<innreport> and especially
its XHTML output (a XSL transformation is also provided, if needed,
in F<innreport-filter.xslt>, in the F<contrib> directory).

=item *

B<inndstart> and B<startinnfeed> are no longer part of INN and are no
longer used.  Instead, a separate setuid root helper program written by
Russ Allbery is used to bind to the news ports (and does only that),
and is run by B<innd> and B<nnrpd> when necessary.  This means that INN
may not be able to increase file descriptor limits for itself the way
that it could before.  If you get error messages about resetting the file
descriptor limits, you may need to increase the file descriptor limits
as root before running B<rc.news> as the news user.  See the sample init
script in F<contrib> for an example of how to do this.  More information
on file descriptor limits can be found in F<INSTALL>.

=item *

INN's IPv6 support was largely rewritten by Russ Allbery.  IPv4 and IPv6
are now handled through the same code wherever possible, the new
IPv6-aware APIs are used everywhere possible, and replacement functions
are provided for systems that don't have them yet.  The network code is
now much more centralized, eliminating lots of duplicate code and adding
better IPv6 support to some utilities.

=item *

INN now uses S<autoconf 2.61> or later for configuration.  As a result,
some C<configure> options have changed slightly and more of the standard
B<--*dir> options should be supported in lieu of the old INN-specific
options.  See C<configure --help> for the available options.

=item *

Thanks to Kirill Berezin, the buffindexed overview method now supports
buffers larger than S<2 GB>.  It is not necessary to compile INN with
large file support to use such large buffers with buffindexed.
Buffindexed is now also more robust with mmaped files and uses more
optimized data placement.

=item *

B<tinyleaf>, a miniature IHAVE-only leaf server written by Russ Allbery,
is now included.  See the tinyleaf(8) man page for more information.

=item *

B<controlchan> recognizes the new application/news-groupinfo entity
described in USEPRO and can handle character set conversions of newsgroup
descriptions.  The C<MIME::Parser> and C<Encode> modules are used.
Processing control messages has been greatly improved, especially
checkgroups:  the F<active> and F<newsgroups> files are now properly
updated when they are processed, and all matching lines in F<control.ctl>
for a given checkgroups are honoured (which for instance allows using
both B<drop> and B<doit> actions for the same checkgroups message).

A new F<control.ctl.local> file has also been added in I<pathetc>.  Rules
set in that file override rules in F<control.ctl>, allowing administrators
to specify local rules for some control messages without modifying the
F<control.ctl> configuration file that comes with INN.  It also specifies
encodings to use for the F<newsgroups> file.  By default, UTF-8 will be
used for newsgroup descriptions, as strongly recommended by S<RFC 3977>.

=item *

The Perl and Python I<filter_mode> hooks are now called when B<innd> is
shutting down via either C<ctlinnd shutdown> or C<ctlinnd xexec> with a
new mode value of C<shutdown>.  This will allow the Perl hooks to save
filter data across B<innd> restarts without requiring that the news
administrator throttle the server first.  (Python already had a separate
close hook that is also called.)

=item *

The legacy B<innshellvars.pl> script has been replaced with a real INN
Perl module C<INN::Config> for Perl programs.  The location of Perl
modules can be set with the B<--with-libperl-dir> option to C<configure>.
All Perl scripts shipped with INN have been converted to use that module.
You may want to consider using C<INN::Config> in your Perl scripts, though
B<innshellvars.pl> is still provided with INN.

=item *

Support for embedded Tcl filters in B<innd> has been removed.  It hasn't
worked for some time and causes B<innd> crashes if compiled in (even if
not used).  If someone wants to step forward and maintain it, we recommend
starting from scratch and emulating the Perl and Python filters.

=item *

If I<strippath> is set in F<readers.conf>, the whole user-supplied Path:
header will now be stripped.  Previously, the final component of the
user-supplied Path: would still be retained.

=item *

B<news2mail> can now set the envelope-from address of the mails it sends.
A third optional part in F<news2mail.cf> entries has been added by
S<D. Stussy> to achieve that.

=item *

The B<-g> option to B<nnrpd> is no longer supported.  If you are verifying
passwords against the system password database, see the ckpasswd(8) man
page, and in particular the B<-s> option.  (A much better idea would be to
just use PAM, which B<ckpasswd> supports.)

=item *

Fixed a bug in C<ctlinnd renumber> which was resetting the low and high
water marks of empty newsgroups in the F<active> file.  This command
now makes the low water mark one more than the real high water mark.
The answers to LIST ACTIVE, GROUP and LISTGROUP have also been fixed
to do that.

=item *

Support for bzip2-compressed batches (with B<bunbatch>) has been added.

=item *

B<news.daily> now processes B<innfeed> dropped files during daily
maintenance, running B<procbatch>.

=item *

Support for I<runasuser> and I<runasgroup> parameters in F<inn.conf>
allows setting the news user and the news group under which the news server
runs.  Thanks to Ivan Shmakov for this feature.

New other options have been added to configuration files:  I<ignore> in
F<incoming.conf>, I<logstatus>, I<nnrpdflags> and I<verifygroups> in
F<inn.conf>, and I<log-time-format> in F<innfeed.conf>.

The B<--with-http-dir> option has also been added to C<configure> to set
I<pathhttp> in F<inn.conf>.

The I<nntpactsync> parameter has been renamed to I<incominglogfrequency>
in F<inn.conf>.

=item *

The F<sasl.conf> file has been removed in favour of new parameters in
F<inn.conf> to deal with TLS support:  I<tlscafile>, I<tlscapath>,
I<tlscertfile> and I<tlskeyfile>.

=item *

The F<overview.fmt> file has been removed in favour of new parameters
in F<inn.conf> to deal with transition periods to accommodate
overview reconfigurations.  It is now possible to specify on the one
hand the fields that should be advertised by B<nnrpd> in response to
LIST OVERVIEW.FMT and used for HDR, XHDR and XPAT requests (see the new
I<extraoverviewadvertised> parameter) and on the other hand the
additional fields that should be silently generated (see the new
I<extraoverviewhidden> parameter).

=item *

Support for S<Berkeley DB> versions prior to 4.3 has been dropped.  You
will have to use at least S<Berkeley DB 4.4>; the recommended version is
4.7.

=item *

INN now builds entirely free of warnings from GCC with fairly aggressive
warning options enabled.  This involved lots of cleanup of const strings,
signed versus unsigned type handling, correcting printf formats, and other
changes that fixed obscure bugs and made INN's code more robust.  Russ
Allbery has also done considerable cleanup work on some of INN's
internals, simplifying, refactoring, and removing duplicate code.

=item *

INN's test suite is now much more comprehensive and tests some high-level
functions as well as more of the portability and utility function layer.

=item *

A lot of work has been done on documentation:  improvements of existing
documents, new documentation, and proof-reading.  Sample configuration
files are also more detailed.

=head1 Changes in 2.4.6

=over 2

=item *

Fixed the segfault of the radius authenticator when none of the radius
servers respond.  Thanks to Matija Nalis for this patch.

=item *

Fixed a lost initialization in buffindexed, which resolves a potential
segfault, thanks to a patch by Kirill Berezin.

=item *

INN now properly supports S<Perl 5.10.0> (and also 5.8.9); Perl filters
were causing B<innd> to segfault on a few systems like FreeBSD.

=item *

Fixed a long-standing bug which affected Perl hooks for B<innd>:
the variable containing the body of an article was not properly
created, which caused regular expressions matching new lines to fail.
It especially affected filters like Cleanfeed which sometimes
failed to detect unwanted articles.

To fix that issue, Julien Elie added the use of a shared string,
available since S<Perl 5.7.2>, with a fall back to a slower but
reliable copy of such bodies in case the function is not available.
Using a Perl version superior to 5.7.2 is therefore recommended.

=item *

Fixed two bugs which could prevent B<nnrpd> from being run as a daemon
in FreeBSD.  Thanks to Johan van Selst for having identified the
problem and to Kai Gallasch for having provided a testing FreeBSD server.
The listening address was not initialized to C<::0> or C<0.0.0.0> when
the B<-b> flag was not used and an incorrect size was given when IPv6
was enabled and the binding done using IPv4.

=item *

Some annoying assertion failures occurring in B<innfeed> have been fixed
by Russ Allbery and Julien Elie.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<mod-active> for aliased newsgroups.  Only C<=> was written
to the F<active> file.  Thanks to S<D. Stussy> for this patch.

=item *

Fixed a bug which caused B<innd> not to honour the B<Ad> flag in F<newsfeeds>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the IP address displayed for C<localhost> in B<innd>'s
status file.  It was not correctly initialized.

=item *

Fixed a permission issue:  XHDR and XPAT were not checking the rights
the user had to read articles when accessing them by their message-ID.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the replies of XHDR, XOVER and XPAT when the newsgroup
is empty.  Two initial replies were sent instead of one:  the right C<420>
code followed by a wrong C<224> code.

=item *

When no newsgroup is selected, LISTGROUP now returns the right C<412> code
(instead of C<481>).

=item *

B<inncheck> now uses a range of permissions to see whether the file modes
are correctly set.  Therefore, different configurations depending on the
security the user wants to enforce on his system are possible.

=item *

A new improved version of B<docheckgroups> is shipped with INN.  The B<-u>
flag permits updating automatically the F<newsgroups> file (with a proper
number of tabulations and an alphabetical sort), removing obsolete
descriptions and adding new ones.  A second argument on command-line permits
specifying which newsgroups should not be checked, so as not to treat them.

=item *

An I<email=> keyword has been added by James Ralston to B<news.daily>
in order to supply another mail address than the one set at configure time
for Usenet daily reports.

=item *

An updated F<moderators> file with information about the aioe.*, perl.*
and si.* hierarchies is provided; F<control.ctl> is also up to date.

=item *

INN supports S<Berkeley DB 4.7>, which is the recommended version
to use owing to various bugs affecting previous versions of S<Berkeley DB>.

=item *

Other minor bugs have also been fixed.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.4.5

=item *

Fixed the "alarm signal" around C<SSL_read> in B<nnrpd>:  it allows
a proper disconnection of news clients which were previously hanging
when posting an article through a SSL connection.  Moreover, the
I<clienttimeout> parameter now works on SSL connections.  Thanks to
Matija Nalis for the patch.

=item *

SO_KEEPALIVE is now implemented for SSL TCP connections on systems
which support it, allowing system detection and closing the dead
TCP SSL connections automatically after system-specified time.  Thanks
to Matija Nalis for the patch.

=item *

Fixed a segmentation fault when an article of a size greater than remaining
stack is retrieved via SSL.  Thanks to Chris Caputo for this patch.

=item *

Fixed a few segfaults and bugs which affected both Python B<innd> and B<nnrpd>
hooks.  They no longer check the existence of methods not used by the hooked
script.  An issue with Python exception handling was also fixed, as well as
a segfault fixed by Russ Allbery which happened whenever one closes and then
reopens Python in the same process.  Julien Elie also fixed a bug when reloading
Python filters (they were not always correctly reloaded) and a segfault when
generating access groups with embedded Python filters for B<nnrpd>.
Many thanks to David Hlacik for its bug reports.

=item *

The F<nnrpd.py> stub file in order to test Python B<nnrpd> hooks, as
mentioned in their documentation, is now installed; only F<INN.py> was
previously installed in I<pathfilter>.  Also fixed a bug in F<INN.py>
and add missing methods to it.

=item *

Fixed a long-standing bug in B<innreport> which prevented it from
correctly reporting B<nnrpd> and B<innfeed> log messages.

=item *

Fixed a hang in Perl hooks on (at least) HP/PA since S<Perl 5.10>.

=item *

Fixed a compilation problem on some platforms because of AF_INET6 which
was not inside a HAVE_INET6 block in B<innfeed>.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<innfeed> which contained thrice the same IPs for each
peer; it unnecessarily slowed the peer IP rotation for B<innfeed>.  Thanks,
S<D. Stussy>, for having seen that.  Miquel van Smoorenburg provided the patch.

=item *

A new I<heavily> improved version of B<pullnews> is shipped with this INN
release.  This new version is provided by Geraint Edwards.  He added no
more than S<16 flags>, fixed some bugs and integrated the B<backupfeed>
contrib script by Kai Henningsen, adding again S<6 other> flags.  A
long-standing but very minor bug in the B<-g> option was especially fixed
and items from the to-do list implemented.  Many thanks again to Geraint
Edwards.

=item *

New headers are accessible through Perl and Python B<innd> filtering
hooks.  You will find the exact list in the INN Python Filtering and
Authentication Hooks documentation (F<doc/hook-python>) and in Python
samples.  Thanks to Matija Nalis for this addition of new useful headers.

=item *

New samples for Python B<nnrpd> hooks are shipped with INN:  F<nnrpd_access.py>
for access control and F<nnrpd_dynamic.py> for dynamic access control.  The
F<nnrpd_auth.py> script is now only used for authorization control.  See the
F<readers.conf> man page for more information (especially the I<python_auth>,
I<python_access> and I<python_dynamic> parameters).  The documention about
INN Python Filtering and Authentication Hooks has also been improved by
Julien Elie.

=back

=head1 Changes in 2.4.4

=over 2

=item *

Fixed incomplete checking of packet sizes in the B<ctlinnd> interface in
the no-Unix-domain-sockets case.  This is a potential buffer overflow in
dead code since basically all systems INN builds on support Unix domain
sockets these days.  Also track the buffer size more correctly in the
client side of this interface for the Unix domain socket case.

=item *

Group blocks in F<incoming.conf> are now correctly parsed and no longer
cause segfaults when loading this file.

=item *

Fixed a problem with B<innfeed> continuously segfaulting on amd64 hardware
(and possibly on lots of 64-bit platforms).  Many thanks to Ollivier Robert
for his patch and also to Kai Gallasch for having reported the problem and
provided the FreeBSD server to debug it.

=item *

B<scanlogs> now rotates B<innfeed>'s log file, which prevents B<innfeed>
from silently dying when its log file reaches S<2 GB>.

=item *

S<Perl 5.10> support has been added to INN thanks to Jakub Bogusz.

=item *

Some news clients hang when posting an article through a SSL connection:
it seems that B<nnrpd>'s SSL routines make it wrongly wait for data
completion.  In order to fix the problem, the select() wait is now
just bypassed.  However, the IDLE timer stat is currently not collected
for such connections.  Thanks to Kachun Lee for this workaround.

=item *

Fixed a bug in the display of the used compressor (C<cunbatch> was used
if arguments were passed to B<gzip> or B<bzip2>).

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<mailpost> and B<pullnews> which prevented useful error
messages to be seen.  Also add the B<-x> flag to B<pullnews> in order
to insert Xref: headers in articles which lack one.

=item *

If compiling with S<Berkeley DB>, use its ndbm compatibility layer for
B<ckpasswd> in preference to searching for a traditional dbm library.
INN also supports S<Berkeley DB 4.4>, 4.5 and 4.6 thanks to Marco d'Itri.

=item *

B<ovdb_init> now properly closes stdin/out/err when it becomes a daemon.
The issue was reported by Viktor Pilpenok and fixed by Marco d'Itri.

=item *

Added support for Diablo quickhash and hashfeed algorithms.
It allows distributing the messages among several peers (new B<Q> flag
for F<newsfeeds>).  Thanks to Miquel van Smoorenburg for this
implementation in INN.

=item *

B<innd> now listen on separate sockets for IPv4 and IPv6 connections
if the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option is available.  There might also be
operating systems that still have separate IPv4 and IPv6 TCP implementations,
and advanced features like TCP SACK might not be available on v6 sockets.
Thanks to Miquel van Smoorenburg for this patch.

=item *

The two configuration options I<bindaddress> and I<bindaddress6> can now
be set on a per-peer basis for B<innfeed>.  Setting I<bindaddress6>
to C<none> tells B<innfeed> to never attempt an IPv6 connection to that
host.  Thanks to Miquel van Smoorenburg for this patch.

=item *

Added a I<nnrpdflags> parameter to F<inn.conf> (modelled on the concept
of I<innflags>) to permit passing of command line arguments to instances
of B<nnrpd> spawned from B<innd>.

=item *

A new F<inn.conf> parameter called I<pathcluster> has been added:
it allows appending a common name to the Path: header
on all incoming articles.  I<pathhost> and I<pathalias> (if set)
are still appended to the path as usual, but I<pathcluster>
is always appended as the last element (e.g. on the leftmost
side of the Path: header).  Thanks to Miquel van Smoorenburg for
this feature.

=item *

B<simpleftp> has been rewritten to use C<Net::FTP>.  Indeed, F<ftp.pl>
is no longer shipped with S<Perl 5> and the script did not work.

=item *

B<perl-nocem> will now check for a timeout and re-open the socket
if required.  Additionally, B<perl-nocem> will switch to
cancel_ctlinnd in case cancel_nntp fails after sending
the Message-ID.  Thanks to Christoph Biedl for the patch.  A more
detailed documentation has also been written for perl-nocem(8).

=item *

The RADIUS configuration is now wrapped in a C<server {}> block in
F<radius.conf>.

=item *

Checkgroups when there is nothing to change no longer result in sending
a blank mail to administrators.  Besides, no mail is sent by B<controlchan>
for the creation of a newsgroup when the action is C<no change>.

=item *

Checkgroups are now properly propagated even though the news server
does not carry the groups they are posted to.

=item *

B<controlchan> and B<docheckgroups> now handle wire format messages
so that articles from the spool can be directly fed to them.

=item *

Newgroup control messages for existing groups now change their description.
If a mail is sent to administrators, it reminds them to update their
F<newsgroups> file.  It also warns when there are missing or obsolete
descriptions.  Furthermore, the F<newsgroups> file is now written prettier
(from one to three tabulations between the name of the group and its
short description) and to.* groups cannot be created.

=item *

The sample F<control.ctl> file has been extensively updated.

=item *

Fixed empty LISTGROUP replies which were not terminated.  Thanks to
David Canzi for the patch.

=item *

In response to a LIST [file] command, if the file does not exist,
we assume it is not maintained and return C<503> instead of C<215> and
an empty file.  Moreover, capability to LIST ACTIVE.TIMES for a wildmat
pattern as its third argument has been added in order to select wanted
newsgroups.

=item *

B<inews> now tries to authenticate if it does not receive a C<200> return
code after MODE READER.  Indeed, it might be able to post even with
a C<201> return code and also with another codes like C<440> or C<480>.

=item *

If creating a new F<history> file, set the ownership and mode appropriately.
B<inncheck> also expects fewer things to be private to the news user.  Most
of the configuration files will never contain private information like
passwords.

=item *

Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements.

=head1 Changes in 2.4.3

=over 2

=item *

Previous versions of INN had an optimization for handling XHDR Newsgroups
that used the Xref: header from overview.  While this does make the command
much faster, it doesn't produce accurate results and breaks the NNTP
protocol, so this optimization has been removed.

=item *

Fixed a bug in B<innd> that allowed it to accept articles with duplicated
headers if the header occurred an odd number of times.  Modified the
programs for rebuilding overview to use the last Xref: header if there
are multiple ones to avoid problems with spools that contain such invalid
articles.

=item *

Fixed yet another problem with verifying that a user has permissions to
approve posts to a moderated group.  Thanks, Jens Schlegel.

=item *

Increase the send and receive buffer on the Unix domain socket used by
B<ctlinnd>.  This should allow longer replies (particularly for B<innstat>) on
platforms with very low default Unix domain socket buffer sizes.

=item *

B<rnews>'s handling of articles with nul characters, NNTP errors, header
problems, and deferrals has been significantly improved.

=item *

Thomas Parmelan added support to B<send-uucp> for specifying the funnel or
exploder site to flush for feeds managed through one and fixed a problem
with picking up old stranded work files.

=head1 Changes in 2.4.2

=over 2

=item *

INN is now licensed under a less restrictive license (about as minimally
restrictive as possible shy of public domain), and the clause similar to
the old BSD advertising clause has been dropped.

=item *

C<make install> and C<make update> now always install the newly built binaries,
rather than only installing them if the modification times are newer.
This is the behavior that people expect.  C<make install> now also
automatically builds a new (empty) history database if one doesn't already
exist.

=item *

The embedded Tcl filter code has been disabled (and will be removed
entirely in the next major release of INN).  It hasn't worked for some
time and causes B<innd> crashes if compiled in (even if not used).  If
someone wants to step forward and maintain it, I recommend starting from
scratch and emulating the Perl and Python filters.

=item *

B<ctlinnd> should now successfully handle messages from INN up to the maximum
allowable packet size in the protocol, fixing problems sites with many
active peers were having with B<innstat> output.

=item *

Overview generation has been fixed in both B<makehistory> and B<innd> to follow
the rules in the latest NNTP draft rather than just replacing special
characters with spaces.  This means that the unfolding of folded header
lines will not introduce additional, incorrect whitespace in the overview
data.

B<nnrpd> now uniformly responds with a C<480> or C<502> status code to attempts
to read a newsgroup to which the user does not have access, depending on
whether the user has authenticated.  Previously, it returned a C<411> status
code, claiming the group didn't exist, which confuses the reactive
authentication capability of news readers.

If a user is not authorized to approve articles (using the C<A> I<access>

rejected even if posted to unmoderated groups.  Some other site may
consider that group to be moderated.

The configuration parser used for F<readers.conf> and others now correctly
handles C<#> inside quoted strings and is more robust against unmatched
double quotes.

Messages mailed to moderators had two spaces after the colons in the

SECURITY:  Handle the special filing of control messages into per-type
newsgroups more robustly.  This closes a potentially exploitable buffer
overflow.  Thanks to Dan Riley for his excellent bug report.

=item *

Fixed article handling in B<innd> so that articles without a Path: header
(arising from peers sending malformatted articles or injecting
malformatted articles through rnews) would not cause B<innd> to crash.  (This
was not exploitable.)

Fixed a serious bug in XPAT handling, thanks to Tommy van Leeuwen.

C<configure> now looks for B<sendmail> only in F</usr/sbin> and F</usr/lib>, not on

The robustness of the tradindexed overview method has been further
increased, handling more edge cases arising from corrupted databases and
oddly-named newsgroups.

B<innd> now never decreases the high water mark of a newsgroup when

=head1 Upgrading from 2.3 to 2.4

The F<inn.conf> parser has changed between S<INN 2.3> and 2.4.  Due to that
change, options in F<inn.conf> that contain whitespace or a few other
special characters must be quoted with double quotes, and empty parameters
(parameters with no value) are not allowed.  S<INN 2.4> comes with a script,
B<innupgrade>, run automatically during C<make update>, that will attempt
to fix any problems that it finds with your F<inn.conf> file, saving the
original as F<inn.conf.OLD>.

This change is the beginning of standardization of parsing and syntax
across all of INN's configuration files.

The history subsystem now has a standard API that allows other backends to
be used.  Because of this, you now need to specify the history method in
F<inn.conf>.  Adding:

    hismethod: hisv6

will tell INN to use the same history backend as was used in previous
versions.  B<innupgrade> should take care of this for you.

ovdb is known to have some locking and timing issues related to how B<nnrpd>
shuts down (or fails to shut down) the overview databases.  If you have
stability problems with ovdb, try setting I<readserver> to true in
F<ovdb.conf>.  This will funnel all ovdb reads through a single process
with a cleaner interface to the underlying S<Berkeley DB> database.

If you use Perl authentication for B<nnrpd> (if I<nnrpdperlauth> in
F<inn.conf> is true), there have been major changes.  See "Changes to
Perl Authentication Support for nnrpd" in F<doc/hook-perl> for details.

Similarly, if you use Python authentication for B<nnrpd> (if
I<nnrpdpythonauth> in F<inn.conf> is true), there have been major changes.
See "Changes to Python Authentication and Access Control Support for
nnrpd" in F<doc/hook-python> for details.

If you use B<send-uucp>, it has been completely rewritten and now takes a
configuration file to specify its behavior.  See its man page for more
information.  If you use B<sendbatch>, it is no longer included in INN
since the new B<send-uucp> can handle all of the same functionality.

The wildmat API has been renamed (to uwildmat and friends; see uwildmat(3)
for the interfaces) to distinguish it from Rich $alz's original version,
since it now supports UTF-8.  This may require changes in other software
packages that link against INN's libraries.

If you are upgrading from a version prior to S<INN 2.3>, see L<Upgrading
from 2.2 to 2.3>.

=head1 Changes in 2.4.0

=over 2

=item *

IPv6 support has been added, disabled by default.  If you have IPv6
connectivity, build with B<--enable-ipv6> to try it.  There are no known
bugs, but please report any problems you find (or even successes, if you
use an unusual platform).  There are a few changes of interest; further
information is available in F<doc/IPv6-info>.

=item *

The tradindexed overview method has been completely rewritten and should
be considerably more robust in the face of system crashes.  A new utility,
B<tdx-util>, is provided to examine the contents of the overview database,
repair inconsistencies, and rebuild the overview for particular groups
from a tradspool news spool.  See tdx-util(8) for more details.

=item *

The Perl and Python authentication hooks for readers have been extensively
overhauled and integrated better with F<readers.conf>.  See the Changes
sections in F<doc/hook-perl> and F<doc/hook-python> for more details.

=item *

B<nnrpd> now optionally supports article injection via IHAVE, see
readers.conf(5).  Any articles injected this way must have Date, From,
Message-ID, Newsgroups, Path, and Subject headers.  X-Trace and
X-Complaints-To headers will be added if the appropriate options are set
in F<readers.conf>, but other headers will not be modified/inserted (e.g.
NNTP-Posting-Host, NNTP-Posting-Date, Organization, Lines, Cc, Bcc, and To
headers).

=item *

B<nnrpd> now handles arbitrarily long lines in POST and IHAVE; administrators
who want to limit the length of lines in locally posted articles will need
to add this to their local filters instead.

=item *

B<nnrpd> no longer handles the poorly-specified S<RFC 977> optional fourth
argument to the NEWGROUPS command specifying the "distributions" that the
command was supposed to apply to.

Clients that use that argument will break.  There are not believed to be
any such clients, and it's easy enough to just filter the returned list of
newsgroups (which is generally fairly short) to achieve the same results.

=item *

B<nnrpd> no longer accepts UTC as a synonym for GMT for NEWGROUPS or NEWNEWS.
This usage was never portable, and was rejected by the NNTP working group.
It is being removed now in the hope that it will be caught before anyone
starts to rely on it.

=item *

B<innfeed> supports a new peer parameter, I<backlog-feed-first>, that if set
to true feeds any backlog to a peer before new articles, see
innfeed.conf(5).  When used in combination with I<max-connections> set to C<1>,
this can be used to enforce in-order delivery of messages to a peer that
is doing Xref slaving, avoiding cases where a higher-numbered message is
received before a lower-numbered message in the same group.

=item *

Several other, more minor protocol issues have been fixed:  connections
rejected due to the connection rate limiting in B<innd> receive C<400> replies
instead of C<504> or C<505>, and ARTICLE without an argument will always either
retrieve the current article or return a C<423> error, never advance the
current article number to the next valid article.

See F<doc/compliance-nntp> for all of the known issues with INN's
compliance with the current NNTP draft.

=item *

All accesses to the F<history> file for all parts of INN now go through a
generic API like the storage and overview subsystems do.  This will
eventually allow new history implementations to be dropped in without
affecting the rest of INN, and will significantly improve the
encapsulation of the history subsystem.  See the libinnhist(3) man page
for the details of the interface.

=item *

INN now uses a new parser for the F<inn.conf> file.  This means that
parameters containing whitespace or other special characters must now be
quoted; see inn.conf(5).  It fixes the long-standing bug that certain
values must be included in F<inn.conf> even if using the defaults for the
use of shell or Perl scripts, and it will serve as the basis for
standardizing and cleaning up the configuration file parsing in other
parts of INN.  B<innupgrade> is run during C<make update> and should convert
an existing F<inn.conf> file for you.

=item *

B<send-uucp> has been replaced by a completely rewritten version from
Marco d'Itri, Edvard Tuinder, and Miquel van Smoorenburg, which uses a
configuration file that specifies batch sizes, compression methods, and
hours during which batches should be generated.  The old B<sendbatch>
script has been retired, since B<send-uucp> can now handle everything
that it did.

=item *

Two C<configure> options have changed names:  B<--with-tmp-path> is now
B<--with-tmp-dir>, and B<--with-largefiles> is now B<--enable-largefiles>, to
improve consistency and better match the C<autoconf> option guidelines.

=item *

Variables can now be used in the F<newsfeeds> file to make it easier to
specify many similar feeds or feed patterns.  See the newsfeeds(5) man
page for details.

=item *

Local connections to INN support a new special mode, MODE CANCEL, that
allows efficient batch cancellation of messages.  This is intended to be
the preferred interface for external spam and abuse filters like NoCeM.
See "CANCEL FEEDS" in innd(8) for details.

=item *

Two new options, I<nfsreader> and I<nfswriter>, have been added to
F<inn.conf> to aid in building NFS based shared reader/writer platforms.
On the writer server configure I<nfswriter> to true and on all of the readers
configure I<nfsreader> to true; these options add calls to force data out to
the NFS server and force it to be read directly from the NFS server at the
appropriate moments.  Note that it has only been tested on S<Solaris 8>,
using CNFS as the storage mechanism and tradindexed as the overview
method.

=item *

A new option, I<tradindexedmmap>, has been added to F<inn.conf>.  If set
to true (the default), then the tradindexed overview method will use
mmap() to access its overview data (in 2.3 you couldn't control this; it
always used mmap).

=item *

Thanks to code contributed by CMU, B<innfeed> can now feed an IMAP server as
well as other NNTP servers.  See the man page for innfeed(8) for more
information.

=item *

An authenticator, B<auth_smb>, that checks a username and password against
a remote Samba server is now included.  See auth_smb(8) for details.

=item *

The wildmat functions in INN now support UTF-8, in a way that should allow
them to still work with most simple 8-bit character sets in widespread
use.  As part of this change, some additional wildmat interfaces are now
available and the names have changed (to uwildmat, where C<u> is for
Unicode).  See uwildmat(3) for the details.

=item *

The interface between external authenticators and B<nnrpd> is now properly
documented, in F<doc/external-auth>.  A library implementing this
interface in C is provided, which should make it easier to write
additional authenticators resolvers.  See libauth(3) for details, and any
of the existing programs in F<authprogs/> for examples.

=item *

INN now checks to ensure that the configured temporary directory is
not world-writeable.  Additionally, most (if not all) of the temporary
file creation in INN now uses functions that create temporary files
properly and safely.

B<pgpverify> now supports using GnuPG to check signatures (rather than PGP)

GnuPG installed, B<pgpverify> will use it rather than PGP, which means that
you may have to create a new key ring for GnuPG to use to verify signatures
if you were previously using PGP.

Users can no longer post articles containing Approved: headers to
moderated groups by default; they must be specifically given that
permission with the I<access> parameter in F<readers.conf>.  See the man page

A very long-standing (since S<INN 1.0>!) NNTP protocol bug in B<nnrpd> was

fourth.  Fixing this is reported to I<possibly> cause problems with some
Netscape browsers, but other news servers correctly follow the protocol.

=item *

Some serious performance problems with expiration of tradspool should now
be at least somewhat alleviated.  tradspool and timehash now know how to
output file names for removal rather than tokens, and B<fastrm>'s ability to
remove regular files has been restored.  This should bring expiration
times for tradspool back to within a factor of two of pre-storage-API

=head1 Upgrading from 2.2 to 2.3

There may be additional things to watch out for not listed here; if you
run across any, please let <inn-bugs@isc.org> know about them.

Simply doing a C<make update> is not sufficient to upgrade; the history and
overview information will also have to be regenerated, since the formats
of both files have changed between 2.2 and 2.3.  Regardless of whether you
were using the storage API or traditional spool under 2.2, you'll need to
rebuild your overview and history files.  You will also need to add a
F<storage.conf> file, if you weren't using the storage API under S<INN 2.2>.  A
good default F<storage.conf> file for 2.2 users would be:

    method tradspool {
        newsgroups: *
        class: 0
    }

Create this F<storage.conf> file before rebuilding history or overview.

If you want to allow readers, or if you want to expire based on newsgroup
name, you need to tell INN to generate overview data and pick an overview
method by setting I<ovmethod> in F<inn.conf>.  See F<INSTALL> and inn.conf(5)
for more details.

The code that generates the dbz index files has been split into a separate
program, B<makedbz>.  B<makehistory> still generates the base F<history> file
and the overview information, but some of its options have been changed.
To rebuild the history and overview files, use something like:

    makehistory -b -f history.n -O -T /usr/local/news/tmp -l 600000

(change the F</usr/local/news/tmp> path to some directory that has plenty of
temporary space, and leave off B<-O> if you're running a transit-only server
and don't intend to expire based on group name, and therefore don't need
overview.)  Or if your overview is buffindexed, use:

    makehistory -b -f history.n -O -F

Both will generate a new history file as F<history.n> and rebuild overview
at the same time.  If you want to preserve a record of expired Message-IDs
in the history file, run:

    awk 'NF==2 { print; }' < history >> history.n

to append them to the new history file you created above.  Look over the
new history file and make sure it looks right, then generate the new index
files and move them into place:

    makedbz -s `wc -l < history.n` -f history.n
    mv history.n history
    mv history.n.dir history.dir
    mv history.n.hash history.hash
    mv history.n.index history.index

(Rather than F<.hash> and F<.index> files, you may have a F<.pag> file if you're
using tagged hash.)

For reader machines, F<nnrp.access> has been replaced by F<readers.conf>.
There currently isn't a program to convert between the old format and the
new format (if you'd like to contribute one, it would be welcomed
gratefully).  The new file is unfortunately considerably more complex as
a result of its new capabilities; please carefully read the example
F<readers.conf> provided and the man page when setting up your initial
configuration.  The provided commented-out examples cover the most common
installation (IP-based authentication for all machines on the local
network).

INN makes extensive use of mmap(2) for the new overview mechanisms, so at
the present time NFS-mounting the spool and overview on multiple reader
machines from one central server probably isn't feasible in this version.
mmap tends to interact poorly with NFS (at the least, NFS clients won't
see updates to the mapped files in situations where they should).  (The
preferred way to fix this would, rather than backing out the use of mmap
or making it optional, to add support for Diablo-style header feeds and
pull-on-demand of articles from a master server.)

The flags for B<overchan> have changed, plus you probably don't want to
run B<overchan> at all any more.  Letting B<innd> write overview data itself
results in somewhat slower performance, but is more reliable and has a
better failure mode under high loads.  Writing overview data directly is
the default, so in a normal upgrade from 2.2 to 2.3 you'll want to comment
out or remove your B<overchan> entry in F<newsfeeds> and set I<useoverchan> to
false in F<inn.conf>.

B<crosspost> is no longer installed, and no longer works (even with
traditional spool).  If you have an entry for B<crosspost> in F<newsfeeds>,
remove it.

If you're importing a traditional spool from a pre-storage API INN server,
it's strongly recommended that you use NNTP to feed the articles to your
new server rather than trying to build overview and history directly from
the old spool.  It's more reliable and ensures that everything gets put
into the right place.  The easiest way to do this is to generate, on your
old server, a list of all of your existing article files and then feed
that list to B<innxmit>.  Further details can be found in the FAQ at
L<https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/inn.html>.

If you are using a version of Cleanfeed that still has a line in it like:

    $lines = $hdr{'__BODY__'} =~ tr/\n/\n/;

you will need to change this line to:

    $lines = $hdr{'__LINES__'};

to work with S<INN 2.3> or later.  This is due to an internal optimization of
the interface to embedded filters that's new in S<INN 2.3>.

=head1 Changes in 2.3.0

=over 2

=item *

New F<readers.conf> file (replaces F<nnrp.access>) which allows more
flexible specification of access restrictions.  Included in the sample
implementations is a RADIUS-based authenticator.

=item *

Unified overview has been replaced with an overview API, and there are now
three separate overview implementations to choose from.  One (tradindexed)
is very like traditional overview but uses an additional index file.  The
second (buffindexed) uses large buffers rather than separate files for
each group and can handle a higher incoming article rate while still being
fast for readers.  The third (ovdb) uses S<Berkeley DB> to store overview
information (so you need to have S<Berkeley DB> installed to use it).  The
I<ovmethod> key in F<inn.conf> chooses the overview method to use.

Note that ovdb has not been as widely tested as the other overview
mechanisms and should be considered experimental.

=item *

All article storage and retrieval is now done via the storage API.
Traditional spool is now available as a storage type under the storage
API.  (Note that the current traditional spool implementation causes
nightly expire to be extremely slow for a large number of articles, so
it's not recommended that you use the tradspool storage method for the
majority of a large spool.)

=item *

The timecaf storage method has been added, similar to timehash but storing
multiple articles in a single file.  See F<INSTALL> for details on it.

=item *

INN now supports embedded Python filters as well as Perl and Tcl filters,

=item *

There is preliminary support for news reading over SSL, using OpenSSL.

To simplify anti-abuse filtering, and to be more compliant with news
standards and proposed standards, INN now treats as control messages only
articles containing a Control: header.  A Subject: line beginning with
C<cmsg > is no longer sufficient for a message to be considered a control
message, and the Also-Control: header is no longer supported.

=item *

The INN build system no longer uses subst.  (This will be transparent to
most users; it's an improvement and modernization of how INN is
configured.)

The build and installation system has been substantially overhauled.
C<make update> now updates scripts as well as binaries and documentation,
there is better support for parallel builds (C<make -j>), there is less

handled directly by C<autoconf>.  libtool build support (including shared
