=head1 NAME

passwd.nntp - Passwords for connecting to remote NNTP servers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The file I<pathetc>/passwd.nntp contains host / name / password
triplets for use when authenticating client programs to NNTP servers.
This file is normally interpreted by NNTPsendpassword() in libinn(3).
Blank lines and lines beginning with a number sign (C<#>) are ignored.
All other lines should consist of three or four fields separated by
colons:

    host:name:password
    host:name:password:style

The first field is the name of a host, and is matched in a
case-insensitive manner.  (No detailed matching, such as comparing IP
addresses, is done.)

The second field is a user name, and the third is a password.  If either
the username or password is empty, then that portion of the
authentication will not occur.  (For example, a server may require only
a username, in which case the password is not necessary.  Note that
a username is mandatory with AUTHINFO USER/PASS.)

The optional fourth field specifies the type of authentication to use.
At present, the only recognized "authentication style" is C<authinfo>;
this is also the default.  It means that AUTHINFO USER/PASS commands
are used to authenticate to the remote host.  (These NNTP commands
are described in S<RFC 4643>.)

For example:

    ##  UUNET needs a password, MIT doesn't.
    mit.edu:bbn::authinfo
    uunet.uu.net:bbn:yoyoma:authinfo

This file should not be world-readable.
